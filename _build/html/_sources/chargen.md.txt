# Chargen Basics

## Setup

### Stats

Starting stats: 16, 12 17, 14, 17, 11 (yes, they are egregiously good. Thank Jenna)

### Level

Characters will be starting at level 15 and be limited to martial classes only (Fighter, Rogue, Barbarian, Monk). This is a pretty serious constraint, and some amount of class overlap is unavoidable, so simply don't stress it.

### Feats

No Strixhaven feats or similarly generic feats that allow backdoor spellcasting. Feats like Shadow Touched or Fey Touched are on the table, but they come with a substantial in-setting price, but that price is pretty much 100% lined up with the thematic nature of those feats. Racial feats are in a similar boat. Bottom line, I'm trusting folks to not try to turn to feats as a backdoor into spellcasting, and if you think something might be borderline, then ask about it.

One qualifier, because it may seem like an oddball. While Spell Sniper isn't on the table, Ritual Caster absolutely is.

### Race and Background

These are both super open ended with a similar qualifier to Feats. So long as it's not a route to backdoor spellcasting, then pretty much anything goes. This will implicitly rule out some of the backgrounds (coughStrixhavencough), but that's more about theme than about power level.

If your background _doesn't_ include a feat-comparable special ability, then you may take an additional feat as part of your background. That feat should reflect some element of the background.

## Gear

### Money

Don't worry about money - expect to be broke.

### Starting Equipment

Every character may begin with any amount of mundane equipment, as well as the following:

#### One +2 item

The Following Keywords can be swapped in for a +2

- Acheron (Weapon)
- Resistance (Armor)
- Battering (Shield)
- Corpse Slayer (Weapon)
- Crystal Blade (Weapon)
- Venom (Dagger)
- Dragon Slayer (Weapon)
- Dragon Wing (Bow)
- Flame Tongue (Weapon)
- Gambler's (Weapon)
- Giant Slayer (Weapon)
- Glamoured (Studded Leather)
- Disruption (mace)
- Smiting (Bludgeoning weapon)
- Life Stealing (weapon)
- Wounding (weapon)
- Vicious (weapon)
- Woodcutter (Axe)

#### Two +1 items

The following keywords can be swapped in for a +1

- Adamantine (Weapon or armor)
- Mariner (Armor)
- Hellfire (Weapon)
- Mithral (Armor)
- Sentinel (Shield)
- Serpent Scale (Scale Mail Armor)
- Returning (Thrown Weapons)

#### One Signature item

This is largely unbounded, within the theme of the game. Which is to say, no Staff's of the Archmagi or things that woudl similarly bring in heavy spellcasting, but beyond that, any rarity up to and including artifacts is allowed, with some caveats. These will require discussion with the GM, and for things like Artifacts, there will unquestionably be in-game strings attached. The goal here is to enable one cool thing.

If the one cool thing you want doesn't really have a good option, then we can discuss customization, no problem.

If the one cool thing has some other constraints that make this impractical, we can make other adjustments. For example, one player has chosen a Hammer of Thunderbolts as their signature item, which requires other magic items for its use. We're altering the item list for that character to enable the signature, since that's the priority.
