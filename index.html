        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        <p>
          I and my friends are older nerds with busy schedules, so this has been
          set up as a potential pickup D&D game, for playing quick one shots
          when opportunitites arise or when other things have gone wrong. It's
          also a little bit of a deliberate test of how high level martial D&D
          works and feels for us.
        </p>
        <h1>Is That the Forgotten Realms?</h1>
        <p>Sort of?</p>
        <p>
          The realms is absolutely the starting point, but as with any game,
          there are points of divergence to better suit our table. We more or
          less picked up from the Spellplague destruction of the 4e release,
          rolled the clock forward from there 100ish years to the release of 5e
          (and the occorence of published adventures), then moved the clock
          forward another 20 yeas or so.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest change is, of course, the introduction of Silverglass as a
          major city in the south. Most everything else that has been changed is
          in service of bringing it into being.
