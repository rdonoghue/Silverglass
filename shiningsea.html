            <p>
              OK, so, Everything went to shit in the South a little bit over a
              hundred years ago. In the north, they like to talk about "The
              Spellplague" like it was some kind of discrete event, but they did not
              have their land physically torn apart as the consequences of events
              wreaked havoc on all things magical, and the very earth shifted. The
              land bridge connecting Halruaa to Thindol was shattered. The Lake of
              Steam largely drained away, leaving port cities high and dry, and the
              ancient warring Djinn and Efreet bound to the deserts of Calimshan
              were freed to continue their world-scarring battles. The western half
              of the plains of Shar was reduced to wasteland, and the great wizard
              nation of Halruaa collapsed spectacularly with the failure of their
              magic.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              It didn't all happen at once, and the ripples are still felt to this
              day. In the South, this is referred to a the collapse, and it's
              something the South has been slowly recovering from for generations.
              While some things have been lost forever, new things have emerged in
              their place, and the enduring spirit of the South has proven it is not
              broken by something as trivial as a world-shattering apocalypse.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Things seem to be improving. Thereâ€™s still a hell of a long way to go,
              but the arrow may finally be pointing in the right direction. But
              there are absolutely a lot of factors looking to drag it in the other
              direction.
            </p>
            <h1 id="silverglass">Silverglass</h1>
            <p>
              The free city of Silverglass is actually two different free cities on
              opposite sides of The Neck.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Fireside: </b> The western city,<b>
                The Grand Revived Free City of Sudlophor, Reborn in the Glory of the
                Everlasting Flame</b
              >
              is a very nominally free city. It's well known that it's independence
              from the Skyfire Emirates is fairly nominal, but provides just enough
              of a fig leaf to cover for the Emirates expansionist tendencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Silverside: </b> The eastern city, <b> Novo Argentium</b>, was
              formed by an alliance of nearby nations lookignto keepo the Emirates
              from taking control of the neck. Like Fireside, it's politically
              convenient for Silverside to be a free city, to help blunt any larger
              conflicts.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>The Neck: </b> The stretch of water connecting the Shining Sea to
              the Lake of Steam. It's not easy to navigate since the collapse,
              though its situation has been steadily improving. Much of the grwoth
              of Silverglass has come from traffic through The Neck.
            </p>
            <h1 id="emirates">The Skyfire Emirates</h1>
            <p>
              The former nation of Calimshan fell to ancient powers which were
              released in the collapse, and is now ruled by the Djinnfolk and their
              genasi underlings. After cementign thie power, the Emirates attempted
              to push north into Tethyr, but were stopped decisively. Since then,
              the Emirates have been less overt in their push for expansion, but
              their ambitions are still fairly obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b
                >Calimport: Capital of the Emirates, frequently touted as "the
                greatest metropolis outside of the City of Brass", though those
                touting that line frequently have a vested interest.
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Almraiven:</b> This was the last outpost of Old Calimshan, under
              the protection of one of the old Archmages of the south. However, it
              fell to the Emirates a few years ago. The city was greatly damaged,
              and very little effort has been put into rebuilding it. What rebel
              forces there are in the Emirates call this city their home, and it's
              become a haven for criminals and smugglers.
            </p>
            <h1 id="border">The Border Kingdoms</h1>
            <p>Best. Scam. Ever. Several centuries ago, a land-rich and cash-poor noble hit on the idea of granting land to powerful adventurers for substantial sums. It worked like a charm. There are more wizards towers and personal keeps per square mile here than anywhere in faerun. At this point, the original lord is long since forgotten, and the Border Kingdoms have developed something of an adventurer culture, and are the home to several powerful adventuring companies, and have brought a surprising amount of stability to the region.</p>
            <h1>The Lake of Steam</h1>
            <p>During the collapse, much of the Lake of Steam drained away, reportedly into the Underdark.  In recent decades, the waters have risen again, reconnecting it to the Shining Sea, and enabling trade. </p>
            <p>The "lake" is actually a saltwater sea with a great deal of underwater volcanic activity, contributing to a great deal of extra mineral content. It is very shallow, and most of the shipping traffic is via large rafts or barges. What sea life can be found in the lake is often oddly adapted.</p>
            <p><b>Mintar: </b>Paradoxically, Mintar has suffered more from the rebuilding than any other city.  With the breakdown of water trade across the Lake of Steam, Mintar rose to prominence as a trade hub, and even had ambitions of expansion.  Regrettably, it has found itself positioned along one of the vectors of Skyfire expansion.  To date, it has managed to hold off incursion through a combination of Tehthyrian aide and extensive spending on mercenaries.  Sellswords are a common sight on the city streets, and more open fighting happens around Mintar than anywhere else in the South for the moment. </p>
            <p><b>Ankhapur: </b> Trade gateway to the Thornwood. </p>
            <p><b>Yhep: </b> Best known for its oyster beds, Yhep moved with the water's edge after the collapse, and has settled back near its original location.</p>
            <p><b>Derlusk:</b> City of Music and coins, unoffical seat of the Border Kingdoms.</b></p>
            <h1 id="shaar">Shaar</h1>
            <p>Once upon a time, Shaar was an impossibly huge grassland, stretching to the far side of the contient. It was populated by a wide variety of peoples and creatures, most of whom could live their entire lives without ever leaving the plains.</p>
            <p>Now, Shaar is a wild, dangerous place. Something in the collapse weakened the walls between worlds, and now great storms cross the plains, opening the way to the Feywild and Shadowfell.  Much of the eastern and central plains are now a broken land, where you cannot even be sure of what world you are in, with creatures from all three worlds roaming at will.</p>
            <p>The populace of Shaar has gone in three directions.  Many have fled, seeking new life elsehwere.  Some have adapated, swearing allegiance to alien warlord or opportunistic powers.  Some still endure, especially in the west, where things are not quite as bad.</p>
            <p>Yet.</p>
            <p><b>Ormpur: </b> City of Saffron, this human trade city is the south's largest exporter of its nominal spice.  The city had a rise and fall before the collapse even happened, so it has mostly endured.  However, the size of the camps of refugees that surround the city are makign some nervous, especially those who imagine it would be easy for an encampment to become a seige</p>
            <p><b>Sheirttalar: </b> Once called "The Shining City", Sheirttalar had been the primary gateway for trade for Shaar as well as the easternmost memebr of the Chult Federation, and grew rich as a result.  Unfortunately, the collapse hit them hard, sinking half the city and leaving it in the hands of montrosities. </p>
            <p>Twenty years ago, a combination of Shaar nomads and motivated adventurers helped reclaim the city. Some investment followed, but most of that was redirected to Silverglass.  This was fine for the Shaar however, who claimed the city jointly to serve as a trade gateway.  This plan to restore the shining city has been put on the back burber, as Sheirttalar has become the primary destination for refugees from Shaar who have no idea where to go, save to follow the old trade roads west.</p>
            <h1 id="chult">Chult</h1>
            <p>Prior to the collapse, Chult was a rising power. Rich with natural resources, it formed an alliance with the nations of what is now the Mheir Archipelago, forming a trade league that threatened to overshadow Calimshan.</p>
            <p>The collapse changed everything. First, the sinking of the land bridge destroyed the very idea of the Chult federation.  Chult, of course, responded to the disaster by sending all the ships and supplies it could, thinking that they had been spared the worst of it.   They were wrong.</p>
            <p>The eruption of long dormant volcanoes woke things that had long slept, and horrors came out of the jungle.  Towns were eradicted overnight, and the Chultians were forced to flee to the relative safety of the coast, hoping that when their fleet returned, they could reclaim the mainland.</p> 
            <p>The fleet never came, and its fate was a great mystery that no one was in a position to investigate at the time.  In this darkest of time, help came from an unexpect direction, as the nation of Amn extended an uncharacteristically generous hand, offering resources and guidance, leading to the development of Port Nyanzaru as the hub of Chultian trade, ruled by "Merchant Princes" whose interests were aligned with Amn's. The arrangement was supposed to be a temporary one, but the arrival of a Dragon Turtle kept Chult from effectively rebuilding its own navy. But, thankfully, the kind merchants of Amn were always happy to buy their goods to sell elsewhere in Faerun.</p>
            <p>This left Chult in stasis for decades - dependant on Amnish trade and unable to break free of that dependency.  However, this changed around twenty years ago, when the Final Death came to Faerun.  To many, this was just one more apocalyptic event, but to those in the know, it was the result of dark experiments deep in the heart of Chult, experiments that drew the attention of numerous adventurers and reinvigorated exploration of the mainland.</p>
            <p>This drive lead to the re-establishment of old ties with the Lizardfolk, Tabaxi, Grum, Aarakocra and other nations of Chult. This alliance (which is rumored ot have included a red dragon as well as a smattering of pirates) pulled together the forces to defeat the Dragon Turtle that had been threatening the nation, and in doing so, revealed that the Turtle had been in the employ of Amn since the very start.</p>
            <p>This news energized the Chultians, and in one night, all the merchants of Amn and their allies were gathered upp and shipped off the island.  The Amnian version of this story describes a bloody revolution, but in practice, it went smoothly.  Since then, Chult has been slowly rebuilding its navy, and it has developed a reputation as a haven for pirates and monsters.</p>
            <p><b>Port Nyanzaru:</b> There had been some discussion of burning the city to the ground as a final goodbye to Amn, but the quality of the port was simply too great to abandon.  This remains the island's largest city, and primary port for foreign trade, but it is no longer the seat of power in Chult, as that has been distributed out amongst the new Chult Federation. </p>
            <p><b>Mezro: </b> Capital of the Tabaxi nation of Chult, Mezro was a place of great magic and learning which had been thought destroyed in the collapse.  Instead, it turns out that it had been hidden in a demiplane to escape the dangers, and returned to the world - a little worse for wear - during the events of the Final Death. The returned Tabaxi were an essential part of establishing the Chult Federation.</p>
            <p><b>Ishau:<b></b> This village sank during the collapse, and was destined to be little more than a dinosaur filled ruin.  However, a leader of the Lizard Folk who had been exposed to travelers from Outside Chult determined that his people should know the sea, and they claimed Ishau as their own, building a shipyards there, and plying the waves. They lack the knowledge and resources (for now) to build deep sea craft, but they have shown a fine hand for coastal craft, especially fishing and whaling boats.  Much of the fleet that sailed against the Dragon Turtle was built in Ishau, and the Lizard King's personal ship was crafted here from the Dragon's shell. </p>
            <h1 id="shining">The Shining Sea</h1>
            <p>The Shining Sea is an easy sea to navigate - the weather is predictable and cyclical, and so long as you stay home during monsoon season, you can probably get away with sailing in almost anything.  This ease has meant that every nation and city that touches on the sea touches on every other nation that does the same.  This doesn't make people kinder or more understanding, but it does impress upon them that the world is large, and there are many more people in it than one might think.</p>
            <p><b>Tharsult: </b>Tharsult was a big deal once.  A nation that prized mathematics, they were masters of navigation and accounting, and the banks of Urbeth helped lubricate trade across the Shining Sea.  When the collapse came and sank Urbeth, the impact on trade was immeasurable, as decades of contracts, securities and agreements all sank with it.   Today, the island is sparsely populated, mostly by local herders and farmers.</p>
            <h1 id="elfharrow">Elfharrow</h1>
            <p>Elfharrow has always been a rough patch of terrain, but it has grown dramatically less habitable since the collapse.  Some of that can be explaine dwith climate change, but there's clearly more at work here, as the formerly aesetic, isolationist elves have become progressively more brutal and bloodthirsty.</p>
            <p>Reasonable folk would probably just let the murderous elves live in peace, but Elfharrow encompasses lands that used to be part of Halruaa, and there is always some fool willing to get skinned and eaten in the pursuit of lost magic. </p>
            <p><b>Lushpool: </b> The name wasn't ironic when the city was founded - by all accounts it had been as lovely as its name before the collapse. Now it's a pirate's port, filled with people with nowhere else to go who are willign to spend their time hoping that this isn't the night the elves decide to descend on the town for a light snack. </p>
