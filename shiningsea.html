              OK, so, Everything went to shit in the South a little bit over a
              hundred years ago. In the north, they like to talk about "The
              Spellplague" like it was some kind of discrete event, but they did not
              have their land physically torn apart as the consequences of events
              wreaked havoc on all things magical, and the very earth shifted. The
              land bridge connecting Halruaa to Thindol was shattered. The Lake of
              Steam largely drained away, leaving port cities high and dry, and the
              ancient warring Djinn and Efreet bound to the deserts of Calimshan
              were freed to continue their world-scarring battles. The western half
              of the plains of Shar was reduced to wasteland, and the great wizard
              nation of Halruaa collapsed spectacularly with the failure of their
              magic.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              It didn't all happen at once, and the ripples are still felt to this
              day. In the South, this is referred to a the collapse, and it's
              something the South has been slowly recovering from for generations.
              While some things have been lost forever, new things have emerged in
              their place, and the enduring spirit of the South has proven it is not
              broken by something as trivial as a world-shattering apocalypse.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Things seem to be improving. Thereâ€™s still a hell of a long way to go,
              but the arrow may finally be pointing in the right direction. But
              there are absolutely a lot of factors looking to drag it in the other
              direction.
            </p>
            <h1 id="silverglass">Silverglass</h1>
            <p>
              The free city of Silverglass is actually two different free cities on
              opposite sides of The Neck.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Fireside: </b> The western city,<b>
                The Grand Revived Free City of Sudlophor, Reborn in the Glory of the
                Everlasting Flame</b
              >
              is a very nominally free city. It's well known that it's independence
              from the Skyfire Emirates is fairly nominal, but provides just enough
              of a fig leaf to cover for the Emirates expansionist tendencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Silverside: </b> The eastern city, <b> Novo Argentium</b>, was
              formed by an alliance of nearby nations lookignto keepo the Emirates
              from taking control of the neck. Like Fireside, it's politically
              convenient for Silverside to be a free city, to help blunt any larger
              conflicts.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>The Neck: </b> The stretch of water connecting the Shining Sea to
              the Lake of Steam. It's not easy to navigate since the collapse,
              though its situation has been steadily improving. Much of the grwoth
              of Silverglass has come from traffic through The Neck.
            </p>
            <h1 id="emirates">The Skyfire Emirates</h1>
            <p>
              The former nation of Calimshan fell to ancient powers which were
              released in the collapse, and is now ruled by the Djinnfolk and their
              genasi underlings. After cementign thie power, the Emirates attempted
              to push north into Tethyr, but were stopped decisively. Since then,
              the Emirates have been less overt in their push for expansion, but
              their ambitions are still fairly obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b
                >Calimport: Capital of the Emirates, frequently touted as "the
                greatest metropolis outside of the City of Brass", though those
                touting that line frequently have a vested interest.
              </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Almraiven:</b> This was the last outpost of Old Calimshan, under
              the protection of one of the old Archmages of the south. However, it
              fell to the Emirates a few years ago. The city was greatly damaged,
              and very little effort has been put into rebuilding it. What rebel
              forces there are in the Emirates call this city their home, and it's
              become a haven for criminals and smugglers.
            </p>
            <h1 id="border">The Border Kingdoms</h1>
            <p>Best. Scam. Ever. Several centuries ago, a land-rich and cash-poor noble hit on the idea of granting land to powerful adventurers for substantial sums. It worked like a charm. There are more wizards towers and personal keeps per square mile here than anywhere in faerun. At this point, the original lord is long since forgotten, and the Border Kingdoms have developed something of an adventurer culture, and are the home to several powerful adventuring companies, and have brought a surprising amount of stability to the region.</p>
            <h1>The Lake of Steam</h1>
            <p>During the collapse, much of the Lake of Steam drained away, reportedly into the Underdark.  In recent decades, the waters have risen again, reconnecting it to the Shining Sea, and enabling trade. </p>
            <p>The "lake" is actually a saltwater sea with a great deal of underwater volcanic activity, contributing to a great deal of extra mineral content. It is very shallow, and most of the shipping traffic is via large rafts or barges. What sea life can be found in the lake is often oddly adapted.</p>
