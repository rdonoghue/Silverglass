            <p>
              OK, so, Everything went to shit in the South a little bit over a
              hundred years ago. In the north, they like to talk about "The
              Spellplague" like it was some kind of discrete event, but they did not
              have their land physically torn apart as the consequences of events
              wreaked havoc on all things magical, and the very earth shifted. The
              land bridge connecting Halruaa to Thindol was shattered. The Lake of
              Steam largely drained away, leaving port cities high and dry, and the
              ancient warring Djinn and Efreet bound to the deserts of Calimshan
              were freed to continue their world-scarring battles. The western half
              of the plains of Shar was reduced to wasteland, and the great wizard
              nation of Halruaa collapsed spectacularly with the failure of their
              magic.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              It didn't all happen at once, and the ripples are still felt to this
              day. In the South, this is referred to a the collapse, and it's
              something the South has been slowly recovering from for generations.
              While some things have been lost forever, new things have emerged in
              their place, and the enduring spirit of the South has proven it is not
              broken by something as trivial as a world-shattering apocalypse.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Things seem to be improving. Thereâ€™s still a hell of a long way to go,
              but the arrow may finally be pointing in the right direction. But
              there are absolutely a lot of factors looking to drag it in the other
              direction.
            </p>
            <h1 id="silverglass">Silverglass</h1>
            <p>
              The free city of Silverglass is actually two different free cities on
              opposite sides of The Neck.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Fireside: </b> The western city,<b>
                The Grand Revived Free City of Sudlophor, Reborn in the Glory of the
                Everlasting Flame</b
              >
              is a very nominally free city. It's well known that it's independence
              from the Skyfire Emirates is fairly nominal, but provides just enough
              of a fig leaf to cover for the Emirates expansionist tendencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Silverside: </b> The eastern city, <b> Novo Argentium</b>, was
              formed by an alliance of nearby nations lookignto keepo the Emirates
              from taking control of the neck. Like Fireside, it's politically
              convenient for Silverside to be a free city, to help blunt any larger
              conflicts.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>The Neck: </b> The stretch of water connecting the Shining Sea to
              the Lake of Steam. It's not easy to navigate since the collapse,
              though its situation has been steadily improving. Much of the grwoth
              of Silverglass has come from traffic through The Neck.
            </p>
            <h1 id="emirates">The Skyfire Emirates</h1>
            <p>
              The former nation of Calimshan fell to ancient powers which were
              released in the collapse, and is now ruled by the Djinnfolk and their
              genasi underlings. After cementign thie power, the Emirates attempted
              to push north into Tethyr, but were stopped decisively. Since then,
              the Emirates have been less overt in their push for expansion, but
              their ambitions are still fairly obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b
                >Calimport:  </b>Capital of the Emirates, frequently touted as "the
                greatest metropolis outside of the City of Brass", though those
                touting that line frequently have a vested interest.
             
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Almraiven:</b> This was the last outpost of Old Calimshan, under
              the protection of one of the old Archmages of the south. However, it
              fell to the Emirates a few years ago. The city was greatly damaged,
              and very little effort has been put into rebuilding it. What rebel
              forces there are in the Emirates call this city their home, and it's
              become a haven for criminals and smugglers.
            </p>
            <h1 id="border">The Border Kingdoms</h1>
            <p>Best. Scam. Ever. Several centuries ago, a land-rich and cash-poor noble hit on the idea of granting land to powerful adventurers for substantial sums. It worked like a charm. There are more wizards towers and personal keeps per square mile here than anywhere in faerun. At this point, the original lord is long since forgotten, and the Border Kingdoms have developed something of an adventurer culture, and are the home to several powerful adventuring companies, and have brought a surprising amount of stability to the region.</p>
            <h1>The Lake of Steam</h1>
            <p>During the collapse, much of the Lake of Steam drained away, reportedly into the Underdark.  In recent decades, the waters have risen again, reconnecting it to the Shining Sea, and enabling trade. </p>
            <p>The "lake" is actually a saltwater sea with a great deal of underwater volcanic activity, contributing to a great deal of extra mineral content. It is very shallow, and most of the shipping traffic is via large rafts or barges. What sea life can be found in the lake is often oddly adapted.</p>
            <p><b>Mintar: </b>Paradoxically, Mintar has suffered more from the rebuilding than any other city.  With the breakdown of water trade across the Lake of Steam, Mintar rose to prominence as a trade hub, and even had ambitions of expansion.  Regrettably, it has found itself positioned along one of the vectors of Skyfire expansion.  To date, it has managed to hold off incursion through a combination of Tehthyrian aide and extensive spending on mercenaries.  Sellswords are a common sight on the city streets, and more open fighting happens around Mintar than anywhere else in the South for the moment. </p>
            <p><b>Ankhapur: </b> Trade gateway to the Thornwood. </p>
            <p><b>Yhep: </b> Best known for its oyster beds, Yhep moved with the water's edge after the collapse, and has settled back near its original location.</p>
            <p><b>Derlusk:</b> City of Music and coins, unoffical seat of the Border Kingdoms.</b></p>
            <h1 id="shaar">Shaar</h1>
            <p>Once upon a time, Shaar was an impossibly huge grassland, stretching to the far side of the contient. It was populated by a wide variety of peoples and creatures, most of whom could live their entire lives without ever leaving the plains.</p>
            <p>Now, Shaar is a wild, dangerous place. Something in the collapse weakened the walls between worlds, and now great storms cross the plains, opening the way to the Feywild and Shadowfell.  Much of the eastern and central plains are now a broken land, where you cannot even be sure of what world you are in, with creatures from all three worlds roaming at will.</p>
            <p>The populace of Shaar has gone in three directions.  Many have fled, seeking new life elsehwere.  Some have adapated, swearing allegiance to alien warlord or opportunistic powers.  Some still endure, especially in the west, where things are not quite as bad.</p>
            <p>Yet.</p>
            <p><b>Ormpur: </b> City of Saffron, this human trade city is the south's largest exporter of its nominal spice.  The city had a rise and fall before the collapse even happened, so it has mostly endured.  However, the size of the camps of refugees that surround the city are makign some nervous, especially those who imagine it would be easy for an encampment to become a seige</p>
            <p><b>Sheirttalar: </b> Once called "The Shining City", Sheirttalar had been the primary gateway for trade for Shaar as well as the easternmost memebr of the Chult Federation, and grew rich as a result.  Unfortunately, the collapse hit them hard, sinking half the city and leaving it in the hands of montrosities. </p>
            <p>Fifteen years ago, a combination of Shaar nomads and motivated adventurers helped reclaim the city. Some investment followed, but most of that was redirected to Silverglass.  This was fine for the Shaar however, who claimed the city jointly to serve as a trade gateway.  This plan to restore the shining city has been put on the back burber, as Sheirttalar has become the primary destination for refugees from Shaar who have no idea where to go, save to follow the old trade roads west.</p>
            <h1 id="chult">Chult</h1>
            <p>Prior to the collapse, Chult was a rising power. Rich with natural resources, it formed an alliance with the nations of what is now the Mheir Archipelago, forming a trade league that threatened to overshadow Calimshan.</p>
            <p>The collapse changed everything. First, the sinking of the land bridge destroyed the very idea of the Chult federation.  Chult, of course, responded to the disaster by sending all the ships and supplies it could, thinking that they had been spared the worst of it.   They were wrong.</p>
            <p>The eruption of long dormant volcanoes woke things that had long slept, and horrors came out of the jungle.  Towns were eradicted overnight, and the Chultians were forced to flee to the relative safety of the coast, hoping that when their fleet returned, they could reclaim the mainland.</p> 
            <p>The fleet never came, and its fate was a great mystery that no one was in a position to investigate at the time.  In this darkest of time, help came from an unexpect direction, as the nation of Amn extended an uncharacteristically generous hand, offering resources and guidance, leading to the development of Port Nyanzaru as the hub of Chultian trade, ruled by "Merchant Princes" whose interests were aligned with Amn's. The arrangement was supposed to be a temporary one, but the arrival of a Dragon Turtle kept Chult from effectively rebuilding its own navy. But, thankfully, the kind merchants of Amn were always happy to buy their goods to sell elsewhere in Faerun.</p>
            <p>This left Chult in stasis for decades - dependant on Amnish trade and unable to break free of that dependency.  However, this changed around twenty years ago, when the Final Death came to Faerun.  To many, this was just one more apocalyptic event, but to those in the know, it was the result of dark experiments deep in the heart of Chult, experiments that drew the attention of numerous adventurers and reinvigorated exploration of the mainland.</p>
            <p>This drive lead to the re-establishment of old ties with the Lizardfolk, Tabaxi, Grum, Aarakocra and other nations of Chult. This alliance (which is rumored ot have included a red dragon as well as a smattering of pirates) pulled together the forces to defeat the Dragon Turtle that had been threatening the nation, and in doing so, revealed that the Turtle had been in the employ of Amn since the very start.</p>
            <p>This news energized the Chultians, and in one night, all the merchants of Amn and their allies were gathered upp and shipped off the island.  The Amnian version of this story describes a bloody revolution, but in practice, it went smoothly.  Since then, Chult has been slowly rebuilding its navy, and it has developed a reputation as a haven for pirates and monsters.</p>
            <p><b>Port Nyanzaru:</b> There had been some discussion of burning the city to the ground as a final goodbye to Amn, but the quality of the port was simply too great to abandon.  This remains the island's largest city, and primary port for foreign trade, but it is no longer the seat of power in Chult, as that has been distributed out amongst the new Chult Federation. </p>
            <p><b>Mezro: </b> Capital of the Tabaxi nation of Chult, Mezro was a place of great magic and learning which had been thought destroyed in the collapse.  Instead, it turns out that it had been hidden in a demiplane to escape the dangers, and returned to the world - a little worse for wear - during the events of the Final Death. The returned Tabaxi were an essential part of establishing the Chult Federation.</p>
            <p><b>Ishau:</b> This village sank during the collapse, and was destined to be little more than a dinosaur filled ruin.  However, a leader of the Lizard Folk who had been exposed to travelers from Outside Chult determined that his people should know the sea, and they claimed Ishau as their own, building a shipyards there, and plying the waves. They lack the knowledge and resources (for now) to build deep sea craft, but they have shown a fine hand for coastal craft, especially fishing and whaling boats.  Much of the fleet that sailed against the Dragon Turtle was built in Ishau, and the Lizard King's personal ship was crafted here from the Dragon's shell. </p>
            <h1 id="shining">The Shining Sea</h1>
            <p>The Shining Sea is an easy sea to navigate - the weather is predictable and cyclical, and so long as you stay home during monsoon season, you can probably get away with sailing in almost anything.  This ease has meant that every nation and city that touches on the sea touches on every other nation that does the same.  This doesn't make people kinder or more understanding, but it does impress upon them that the world is large, and there are many more people in it than one might think.</p>
            <p><b>Tharsult: </b>Tharsult was a big deal once.  A nation that prized mathematics, they were masters of navigation and accounting, and the banks of Urbeth helped lubricate trade across the Shining Sea.  When the collapse came and sank Urbeth, the impact on trade was immeasurable, as decades of contracts, securities and agreements all sank with it.   Today, the island is sparsely populated, mostly by local herders and farmers.</p>
            <h1 id="elfharrow">Elfharrow</h1>
            <p>Elfharrow has always been a rough patch of terrain, but it has grown dramatically less habitable since the collapse.  Some of that can be explaine dwith climate change, but there's clearly more at work here, as the formerly aesetic, isolationist elves have become progressively more brutal and bloodthirsty.</p>
            <p>Reasonable folk would probably just let the murderous elves live in peace, but Elfharrow encompasses lands that used to be part of Halruaa, and there is always some fool willing to get skinned and eaten in the pursuit of lost magic. </p>
            <p><b>Lushpool: </b> The name wasn't ironic when the city was founded - by all accounts it had been as lovely as its name before the collapse. Now it's a pirate's port, filled with people with nowhere else to go who are willign to spend their time hoping that this isn't the night the elves decide to descend on the town for a light snack. </p>
            <h1 id="halruaa">Halruaa</h1>
            <p>IN it's heyday, Halruaa was a reknown center of magic.  Said to be the last survivors of the Netheril Empire, they made the practice of magic the central part of their culture, and were responsible for many wonders.  Unfortunately, this elevation of magic left them vulnerable to the spellplague when the collapse came. So many different things went wrong that it's impossible to point at any one cause for Halruaa's fall, but what is known is that what remains is a dangerous, magic blasted wastedland. </p>
            <p><b>Ruins of Halaraah: </b> The old capital of Halruaa, the greatest concentration of the nation's magic could be found here.  As such, it's been a beacon to adventurers looking to brave the wastes in search of lost treasures.  The successes have been spectacular, but greatly outnumbered by the failures.</p>
            <p><b>Halport: </b> To call Halport a city is a gross exaggeration.  Rather, it's the closest (reasonably) safe port to Halruaa, and as such is the preferred stopping point for adventurers.  Most of the permanent residents of the Halport are there to make money off the poor suckers headed inland.</p>
            <h1 id="mhair">The Mhair Archipelago</h1>
            <p>Prior to the collapse, there was a great land bridge that ran from Halruaa to Chult. Much of it now lies beneath the waves, leaving behind a chain of islands.  The largest islands are well known by now, but innumerable small islands surround them, many of which remain unmapped.</p>
            <p><b>Hazur: </b> The Hazur mountains had split the old land bridge, and while the land beneath them sunk, the peaks remained above water.  The result is a profoundly unfriendly island, with very little soil or arable ground, and no good locations for ports.</p><p>Still, the island is not uninhabited.  The dwarves who lived within the mountains now find themselves the masters of an island domain, a situation they were profoundly unprepared for.  Even more water averse than most dwarf clans, they have simply opted to keep carving out more space underground.  They maintain a port of sorts - a tunnel mouth that comes out above the water, with ropes and pulleys to transfer goods.  They don't see many traders though, as the waters around Hazur are dangerous, and the port is well hidden.</p>
            <p><b>Lapal: </b> Lapal had been a nations with strong ties to Chult and Halruaa, and long standing antipathy towards Thindol, who had enslaved them in the distant past.  That antipathy still remains, but sees little outlet - Lapal has been slow to rebuild, as it lacks the resources for any serious shipbuilding, so the populace has focused on agriculture and fishing. As the south has risen, trade has picked up, and Lapal has gained a reputation as a source of first rate fruits, but that success has also increased the amount of pirate activity in its waters. </p>
            <p><b>Delselar: </b> The great city for which it had been best known is long since sunk, and the island has largely reverted to the wilderness.  The few fishing villages that had remained are long since empty. The assumption is that the inhabitants were taken to Thindol, but some whisper of monsters native to the island itself. </p>
            <p><b>Westwall: </b></p> Like Hazur, Westwall is the remains of a former mountain range.  Unline Hazur, the dwarves in those mountains failed to adapt to the new situation, while the goblin tribes of the mountains were quick to strike.  Today, Hazur is a (Lagrely unacknowledged) goblin nation and a haven for pirates, taking advantage of its distance from naval powers and proximity to Halruaa to keep itself relatively safe. 
            <h1 id="tethyr">Tethyr</h1>
            <p>Called The Riverlords by their neighbors, Tethyr is a fertile, abundant nation.  Blessed with an excellent climate and build bweteen two wide river valleys, the nation's wealth of resources have always atracted attention from neighbors, attention that Tethyr has become well accustomed to addressing.</p>
            <p>The joke of the nickname is that Tethyr is absolutely awash with nobles, albeit very minor ones.  There is a king, and a small number of titled nobility, but beyond that are many, many, MANY knights.  Some are landed knights, others are members of knight orders.  The upshot is that Tethyr has a LOT of knights, and by extension, a lot of castles, bridges to fight over, and other seemingly romantic elements.  It might seem almost satorical were it not for the fact that the Knights of Tethyr have stood against every challenge to come down the pike, and have yet to take an L.</p>
            <p>For all the romantic imagery associated with Tethyr, the nation has been shaped by the realities of having very dangerous neighbors, and more than one enemy has found themselves outmaneuvered by the "unsophisticed" knights they were dealing with. </p>

            <h1 id="amn">Amn</h1>
            <p>In  Amn, virtue comes from work, and work produces rewards, so there is no greater measure of virtue than the coins in your pocket. In Amn, nothing is more important than money, a fact that can seem baffling to those who have only seen the simple robes of Amnian merchants, not understanding that money is for *having*, not for showing off.  Some of the greatest complexities of Amnian culture revolve around ways to show that you have money without looking like you're showing off.</p>
            <p>Amn is not a military power, though they will spend coin on mercenaries as needed.  But they are utterly ruthless merchants and competitors who are willing to play the long game.  One of their go to moves is to offer support to nobles (or even nations) who find themselves in dire straits.  The help is then structured in a way to keep the client happy, but reliant on Amn.  Many people of import are in Amn's pocket without even realizing it, for it seems to them as if their interests have simply lined up with the traders.</p>
            <p>There is no public admission of this, but the loss of Chult was a severe blow to Amn.  Chult had been treated like a bottomless purse, and there is quiet debate in back rooms and coffee shops over whether the problem was that Amn took to much, or if Amn was too lax.  That the real answer may not actually revolve around Amn is not a perspective that tends to come up.</p>
            <h1 id="thornwood">The Thornwood</h1>
            <p>During the collapse, the Thornwood saw a likely-supernatural surge of growth, expanding to encopass the nearby Winterwood and Annkwood into a single, vast forest.   Its borders seem to have stabilized, but it's not truly dormant.  While logging and exploration seems reasonably safe around the edges, what goes on in the depth of the Thornwood is still a mystery.</p>
            <h1 id="thindol">Thindol</h1>
            <p>To most of the south, Thindol is a slightly isolationist nation which allows only a small amount of trade locally, but which will enthiastically ship goods and merchants elsewhere. What is less well known is that two hundred years ago, the nation of Thindol went to war against the Yuan Ti, with allies from Chult, Samarach, Lapal and even Nimbral  at their back.  The Yuan Ti were grealty outmatched, and suffered sufficient losses to force them to change tactics. They ensured their "loss" was as visible and dramatic as possible, and fled to the shadows, beginning an effort to systematically replace much of the rulership of Thindol.</p>
            <p>As such, Thindol's secret is that the seemingly human nation is secretly under Yuan Ti controls.  This secret is protected with the uptmost care, including the Yuan Ti themselves filling madmens heads with tales of "secret lizard people of thindol", ensuring that the very idea has become synonymous with irrational delusions and paranoia.</p>
            <p><b>Thindar: </b> Capital of Thindol, but very unwelcome to outsiders.  Rather than use threats or intimidation, the Yuan Ti have built their walls out of bureaucracy and process, and they are high and thick indeed. </p>
            <h1 id="samarach">Samarach</h1>
            <p>The state of Samarach is something of an open question.  Small fishing towns dot the coast, but each will warn against heading inland, for fear of the things that have come down from the mountains. Scholars note that in the past, the mountains of Amarach were potected by powerful illusions, and there is concern that these ancient magics are now wreaking havoc.</p>
            <p><b>Samargol: </b> The city still stands at the river mouth, but is largely unoccupied, as the lack of river trade means there's little reason to grow.  Locals go on regular expeditions to make sure nothing unpleasant has set up camp in the empty districts.</p>
            <h1 id="erlkazar">Erlkazar</h1>
            <p>Blessed with the strong martial traditions born of old ties to Tethyr, Elrkazar was not so blessed in the realm of resources.  The land of Erlkazar is hard - hilly rocky terrain that produces little in abundance, but has native dangers aplenty. The lords of Erlkazar strive to keep their holdings safe, but the spaces between each holding are often threatened by bandits or monsters.  People don't open their doors at night in Erlkazar, and for good reason.</p>
            <p>There is a joke that Erlkazar's greatest defense is that no one would ever <i>want</i> to conquer it, but those who know the nation know that an attacker would pay a steep price for every bloody inch they tried to claim. </p>
            <h1 id="velen">Velen</h1>
            <p>A former duchy of Tethyr, Velen declared independence shortly before the collapse, and managed to maintain it as a result of competing priorities. Though there had been some tensions, the two nations are very close allies these days </p>
            <p>While still largely independant, Amn has more influence in Velen than it does Tethyr, but Velen views it as a necessary partnership, since it's Velen's ships and soldiers who deal with the pirates that would otherwise be raiding Amnish ships. </p>
            <h1 id="lost">Lost Places</h1>

              <p>A number of cities were lost in the collapse and its aftermath.  They fall into three broad categories.  </p>
              
              <p> First. There were a number of <b>abandoned</b> cities, places that were largely deserted when the changes to the environment made them unlivable.  The majority of these were in the area around the Lake of Steam, but there are absolutely others which were abandoned for similar situational reasons.    With the rising of the Lake,  some of these are in the process of being reclaimed, but this is easier said than done.  While the cities may have been abandoned by their original occupants, that does not mean the cities stayed empty.</p>
              
              <p> Second, there are the <b>sunken</b> cities, those who disappeared beneath the water during the collapse.  Most of these were on the Chultian land bridge, and it is well known that the cities of the Chult League were blessed with no shortage of precious metals and powerful magics. There is always interest in reclaiming those lost treasures, but it's easier said than done.   Many are claimed by the undersea kingdoms of the Shining Sea these says, and others are said to have stranger protections.</p>
              
              <p>Last, there are the <b>spelltorn</b> cities, those rendered uninhabitable by the spellplague or other associated releases and destructions of magic.  The term is virtually synonymous with Halruua, but skilled adventurers know that there are more than few spelltorn sites to be found elsewhere around the Shining Sea. </p>
<h2>Lost Places of Note</h2>
            <p><b>Kot Maikaan:</b> A once thriving tent city in central Shaar, it stood at the center of efforts to control the chaos in the grasslands, and served as a meeting point for the many factions of the plains.  Unfortunately, it was razed by the Black Hare and her army of bound spellhaunts, killing many and shattering the hopes of unity. The song, <i>Banners like Grass</i>, recalls the glory of the city, and the tragedy of its fall. </p>

            <p><b>Nimbral, the Seahaven: </b> Nimbral had been nearly mythical before the collapse.  An elvish island nation southwest of Chult, it was known to deploy griffon-mounted troops against pirates, and to misdirect entire fleets with powerful illusions.   Since the collapse, there has been no word from the island nation, and no expedition to seek it out has returned successfully. </p>
            <p>It's not entirely clear who or why, but someone in the Skyfire Emirates has taken a greate interest in Nimbral. Substantial rewards have been promised for credible information about its fate.</p>
            
            <h1 id="groups">Groups</h1>
            <p>(Groups operating across the south (those centered in Silverglass can be foudn there)</p>
            <p><b>Chult Federation: </b> A defunct alliance between Chult, Samarch, Thindol, Hazur, Delselar, Lapal and others.  While the alliance was shattered along with the Mheir Archipelago, since the liberation of Chult, there have been rumors of the Federation rising again.</p>
            <p><b>The Harpers:</b>  Yeah, like those guys give a crap about anything this far south.  The occaisional harper may find their way south, but there is very little in terms of real presence.</p>
            <p><b>The Obsidian Blade: </b> Most often just called "The Blade", these are the agents of the Skyfire Emirates.  They are rarely seen, which has given them an air of mystique that can tip into the domain of conspiracy theory. Agents are skilled elementalists, and make use of elemental servants in pursue of their tasks, ranging from espionage to larg scale destruction.  When operating publically, members wear easily recognizable black masks to obscure their identities. </p>
            <p><b>The Cult of the Serpent: </b> Thhe Serpent Cult has has multiple names over the decades, and has been reported stamped out more than once, but it has been remarkably reslient.   In many places, it simply operates as a secret society - secret handshakes, backroom deals and similar - rather than a organization of "true beleivers".  However, the extra influence held by the true beleivers does draw people deeper into the cult, and there definitely are zealots among their number </p> 

            <h1 id="other">Other Domains</h1>
            <p><H2>The Undersea</H2></p>
              <p>The Shining Sea has its own occupants, but there has historically been something of a truce between those who ply the surface and those who live beneath the waves.  However, many historical channels of communication failed during the collapse, and since then there has been very little insight into the state of things below the sea.  There are rumors, of course.  Great sea monsters.  Flotillas of corpses bobbing to the surface.  Rumors of a great undersea war.   Many questions remain unanswered, and some are worried that the Skyfire Emirates have chosen to deal with the limits to their expansion on land by moving their efforts underwater. </p>
<H2>              
              The Feywild and Shadowfell</H2>
              <p>
              Since the collapse, the connections to the Feywild and Shadowfell have grown more unstable and unpredictable, but no less common.  The collapses reflection on those two realms was - if anything - even more chaotic than it was around The Shining Sea.   While there are few stable connections, there are no shortage of locations which have been touched by the Fey or the Shadow, and over time, some of those might mature into more stable connections.  In the meantime, connections between the realms tend to emerge more in unexpected events.</p>
              <p>
              
              The exception to the is in the Shar - there is no place in the south where it's easier to find yourself in the Feywild or Shadowfell.   Swaths of the grassland fall in and out of these realms, and as a result, the plains have grown stranger and more hostile.  The population of Silverglass and the other new cities has been supplemented by plainsfolk who have given up the Shar, but there are still plenty who remain, finding new ways to live in these new plains. </p>
              <p>
              
              One thing that makes the Feywild and Shadowfell as unpredictable as they are is that the planes still remember the south before the collapse.  Many lost locations are still echoed in light or darkness, though such places are slowly coming unmoored as the world moves on. </p>
              <p>
              
              <H2>The Planes</H2></p>
              <p>
              The Skyfire Emirates sees and absolute abundance of planar traffic, though the majority of that is to the inner planes, and connections to the outer planes are policed very carefully.  This has had an interesting knock on effect in Silverglass however, as the populace is largely comfortable with extra-planar visitors, but the constraints upon the outer planes are weaker or nonexistent, resulting in a populace that is quite cosmopolitan regarding such matters, and hungry for extraplanar goods, which the emirates have historically had a chokehold on. That situation has attracted attention from non-elemental traders from across the planes, and while Silverglass is not yet anything one might describe as a planar hub, such activities don't even raise an eyebrow. </p>
              <p>
              
              <H2>Near Realms</H2></p>
              <p>
              As with the Feywild and the Shadowfell, the collapse's effects were strongly echoed in the ethereal plane, but unlike those places, the ethereal is quicker to restore itself to a semblance of stability.   However, it tends to do so by pushing disturbances off into the far corners of reality, and those things have been known to bubble back up to the surface.  Between Halruua, the Chultian League and Calimshan, the pre-collapse south was absolutely rife with demiplanes and pocket dimensions, and all but the most strongly anchored of those were blown away in the great storm that swept the Ethereal.   Records of most of them were lost with the fall of Chult and Halruua, but adventurers and others have found or reclaimed others.  It is rumored that the location chosen for the rebuilding of Silverglass was influenced by a number of realms anchored there, though this is largely written off as an exaggeration at best.
