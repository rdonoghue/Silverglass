        <h1 id="languages">Languages</h1>
          <ul>         
            <li> Most folks really do speak common, so it's unlikely to be a huge deal.  However, they may not necessarily prefer common, so speaking the right language will offer bonuses to some social rolls.</li><li>The single most useful language to know after common is Primordial.  It's the official court language of the Skyfire Emirates, and elementals are very common throughout the south.  That said, there is still value in speaking specific dialects - if you just know Primordial, it will expand the range of who you can talk to, but you won't be getting language benefits unless you are using a specific elemental dialect.  Also, though it won't come up a lot, there are written differences between the elemental languages that may be hard to overcome without specific knowledge.</li>
            <li>Sylvan is also surprisingly useful, as it was the trade language of Shar,  and can be very useful for communicating with members of the Shar diaspora.
          </li>
          <li>There's not a huge underdark presence (yet), but Undercommon can get you some miles.
          </li>
          <li>Tabaxi is another language with surprising use, as it's actually the modern form of the old Chultian tongue.  Some pieces have been lost in translation over time, but it was the common language of the Chultian League before its...fragmentation.  It's very uncommon in Chult these days, having been supplanted by Common, and some refer to it as a lost language, but such references are usually from people who don't even realize the Tabaxi have a language.
          </li>
          <li>Speaking of dead languages, there are a couple worth noting:
            <ul>
              </li>
              <li>Netherese was the language of the long dead sorcerer kings responsible for many ruins across the realms.  It is, at this point, almost entirely a written language, as no one on Toril has spoken it for centuries.
              </li>
              <li>If they did speak, it would probably sound at least something like Halruuan, since the private language of the wizard kingdom was an offshoot of Netherese, changed across the years.  Halruuan fell out of use with the fall of Halruua, and it's a dead language in terms of any common usage.  However, it was well documented, and spoken by the kinds of people who like to keep meticulous records, so it's still academically viable.
              </li>
              <li>There is a Yuan Ti language.  It's not dead per se, but the Yuan Ti have gone to great length to keep its nature a secret.  There have been no shortage of circumstances where the discovery of some ancient artifact leads to horrible death, and it's attributed to eldritch horror, but was actually a result of extremely diligent Yuan Ti Librarians.  Still, no one is perfect, and a few scholars have evidence of the language, but generally lack information to determine what it is.</li>
              </ul>
          <li>There are actually two Draconic languages: low and high.  Low is spoken by kobolds, dragonborn and similar races.  High is spoken exclusively by dragons, and it may in fact be impossible to speak without draconic anatomy. They use it rarely, and only determined linguists and draconologists are even aware of the distinction.  Notably, if there is a written form of High Draconic, it has never been encountered.
          </li><li>Shadowspeech, sometimes called the tongue of the dead,  is the language of the Shadar Kai, and the common tongue of the shadowfell.
          </li><li>The use of Deep Speech is a crime in many areas of the South, though little effort goes to enforcing this.   The origin of the practice lies in Halruua, whose scholars determined that the language of the Far Realms had an infectious nature, and the presence of its patterns in a living mind was like a beacon to those creatures.</li>

          </ul>

          <h1 id="centaur">Centaur Lore</h1>
          <p>The Centaurs of Shaar don't have much truck with gods.  They acknowledge they exist, of course, but they're like bad weather.  You deal with it, but complain.  Such is life.</p>
          <p>
            For them, much of that role was filled by the heralds of Dawn and Dusk.  Each was a great centaur champion in the past who lives on and guides their people.  The Herald of Dawn is a great lord of the Feywild, and the Herald of Dusk  controls a vast domain in the Shadowfell.  While they do not frequently visit the Grasslands, they are not so absent as to have become abstract - to the Centaur of Shaar, they are very real beings who one will see a few times in a lifetime.</p>
        
          <h1 id="harengon">Harengon Lore</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>All Harengon are related if you look hard enough.  When Harengon meet, the first topic of discussion is the extended family, which is discussed until some point of commonality is found, however distant, and now the speakers may refer to each other as cousins.</li>
          </ul>

          <h1 id="tabaxi">Tabaxi</h1>
          <ul>
          <li>The Tabaxi of the South were culturally anchored in Mezro, their center of accomplishement, magic and knowledge. When it was lost, it devestated them, but it's return has not been entirely joyous, as it's created no small amount of tension between the Tabxi of Mezro and those who were "left behind".</li>
          <li>Southern Tabaxi are organized into several great clans, each of which has a role in society (Priests, Arcanists, Scholars etc), which are in turn composed of clans which tend towards areas of specialty. These, in turn, are composed of actual family units, though it is not hard for a Tabaxi to move between clans.</li>
          <li>In the Tabaxi language, the words for Great Clan, Clan and Faily are all the same word, just delivered with different inflections.</li>
        </ul>
