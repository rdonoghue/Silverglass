       <h2>Played Adventures</h2>
       <ul>
        <li><b>A Slow Boat to Ankhapur</b> - A barge full of booze is attacked by sea serpents and aquatic trolls.<br>
        PCs: Garak, Jax, Bianca, Lorzo, Krongo<br>
        Notable NPCS:  Boat Pilot Oren Stonehelm, The Grime Brothers (and Frisky!)</li>
        
        <li><b>The Mountain of Meat</b> - Tasked with disposing of the body of a titanic creature, things are complicated when someone turns out to have rather gruesome plans for it. <br>
        PCs: Garak(Offscreen), Bianca, Lorzo,Krongo, Fabien<br>
        Notable NPCS: The unnamed Archmage</li>

        <li><b>Laundry Day</b> - Shard's discovery of an archeological anomaly leads to trouble as she and Jax track down it source to Lockhart's Assets as strange hawks attack Redge (who is carrying something for Lackhart) and the laundry where Krongo is working (which is processing a robe from Lockhart). Azim joins the fights against these hawks heroically, but Shards realizes there's a fourth item, which they determine is still at the Bitmer house, which is under attack by a vengeful shade.  Fighting happens as Shards attempts to gather the fourth artifact and lay the spirit to rest. Azim & Redge are both hurt pretty badly, but the enemy is eventually vanquished.<br>
          PCs: Shards, Azim, Redge, Krongo, Jax<br>
          Notable Npcs: Kezzel Lockhart, Liz, Hugh Bitmer</li>

        <li><b>The Flaming Hart</b> (Bianca and Garak)</li>
          <li><b>The Slave Pits of Hazur</b> (Jax & Lorzo)</li>
       </ul>

        <h1 id="languages">Languages</h1>
          <ul>         
            <li> Most folks really do speak common, so it's unlikely to be a huge deal.  However, they may not necessarily prefer common, so speaking the right language will offer bonuses to some social rolls.</li><li>The single most useful language to know after common is Primordial.  It's the official court language of the Skyfire Emirates, and elementals are very common throughout the south.  That said, there is still value in speaking specific dialects - if you just know Primordial, it will expand the range of who you can talk to, but you won't be getting language benefits unless you are using a specific elemental dialect.  Also, though it won't come up a lot, there are written differences between the elemental languages that may be hard to overcome without specific knowledge.</li>
            <li>Sylvan is also surprisingly useful, as it was the trade language of Shar,  and can be very useful for communicating with members of the Shar diaspora.
          </li>
          <li>There's not a huge underdark presence (yet), but Undercommon can get you some miles.
          </li>
          <li>Tabaxi is another language with surprising use, as it's actually the modern form of the old Chultian tongue.  Some pieces have been lost in translation over time, but it was the common language of the Chultian League before its...fragmentation.  It's very uncommon in Chult these days, having been supplanted by Common, and some refer to it as a lost language, but such references are usually from people who don't even realize the Tabaxi have a language.
          </li>
          <li>Speaking of dead languages, there are a couple worth noting:
            <ul>
              </li>
              <li>Netherese was the language of the long dead sorcerer kings responsible for many ruins across the realms.  It is, at this point, almost entirely a written language, as no one on Toril has spoken it for centuries.
              </li>
              <li>If they did speak, it would probably sound at least something like Halruuan, since the private language of the wizard kingdom was an offshoot of Netherese, changed across the years.  Halruuan fell out of use with the fall of Halruua, and it's a dead language in terms of any common usage.  However, it was well documented, and spoken by the kinds of people who like to keep meticulous records, so it's still academically viable.
              </li>
              <li>There is a Yuan Ti language.  It's not dead per se, but the Yuan Ti have gone to great length to keep its nature a secret.  There have been no shortage of circumstances where the discovery of some ancient artifact leads to horrible death, and it's attributed to eldritch horror, but was actually a result of extremely diligent Yuan Ti Librarians.  Still, no one is perfect, and a few scholars have evidence of the language, but generally lack information to determine what it is.</li>
              </ul>
          <li>There are actually two Draconic languages: low and high.  Low is spoken by kobolds, dragonborn and similar races.  High is spoken exclusively by dragons, and it may in fact be impossible to speak without draconic anatomy. They use it rarely, and only determined linguists and draconologists are even aware of the distinction.  Notably, if there is a written form of High Draconic, it has never been encountered.
          </li><li>Shadowspeech, sometimes called the tongue of the dead,  is the language of the Shadar Kai, and the common tongue of the shadowfell.
          </li><li>The use of Deep Speech is a crime in many areas of the South, though little effort goes to enforcing this.   The origin of the practice lies in Halruua, whose scholars determined that the language of the Far Realms had an infectious nature, and the presence of its patterns in a living mind was like a beacon to those creatures.</li>

          </ul>
          <h1 id="lore">Lore</h1>
          <h2 id="centaur">Centaurs</h2>
          <p>The Centaurs of Shaar don't have much truck with gods.  They acknowledge they exist, of course, but they're like bad weather.  You deal with it, but complain.  Such is life.</p>
          <p>
            For them, much of that role was filled by the heralds of Dawn and Dusk.  Each was a great centaur champion in the past who lives on and guides their people.  The Herald of Dawn is a great lord of the Feywild, and the Herald of Dusk  controls a vast domain in the Shadowfell.  While they do not frequently visit the Grasslands, they are not so absent as to have become abstract - to the Centaur of Shaar, they are very real beings who one will see a few times in a lifetime.</p>
        
          <h2 id="harengon">Harengon</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>All Harengon are related if you look hard enough.  When Harengon meet, the first topic of discussion is the extended family, which is discussed until some point of commonality is found, however distant, and now the speakers may refer to each other as cousins.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="tabaxi">Tabaxi</h2>
          <ul>
          <li>The Tabaxi of the South were culturally anchored in Mezro, their center of accomplishement, magic and knowledge. When it was lost, it devestated them, but it's return has not been entirely joyous, as it's created no small amount of tension between the Tabxi of Mezro and those who were "left behind".</li>
          <li>Southern Tabaxi are organized into several great clans, each of which has a role in society (Priests, Arcanists, Scholars etc), which are in turn composed of clans which tend towards areas of specialty. These, in turn, are composed of actual family units, though it is not hard for a Tabaxi to move between clans.</li>
          <li>In the Tabaxi language, the words for Great Clan, Clan and Faily are all the same word, just delivered with different inflections.</li>
        </ul>

<h1 id="Calendar">What Year Is is?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>5374 by the Wizard's calendar.  This doesn't see a lot of common use, but is used in business dealings, and is sort of the GMT of years in the south.</li>
  <li>1515 by the Freeman's Calendar, also called Dale Reckoning, made by a bunch of farmers up north.</li>
  <li>71 by Skyfire reckoning, which is not used by by of anyone outside of the Skyfire Emirateds</li>
  <li>1717 Tethyr reckoning</li>
  <li>2402 by Old Calimshan Reckoning, which does not offcially exist anymore, but is still used by some and exists in many historical records. </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="history">History</h1>
<h2 id="common_knowledge">What Everyone Knows</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the beginning, and an age of the gods, but it ended when the Night serpent devoured the sun and covered the world in darkness. </li>
<li>Eventually, the gods pushed back the dark and the ice and the world was reborn.  These were the <b>Days of Thunder</b>, a time of Dragons and Giants and ancient empires that all warred and destroyed themselves </li>
<li>Their chaos was eventually pushed back in the <b>Dawn Age</b>, when the empires of the Elves (and Dwarves) spread over the realm in peace, and lived side by side with many races.  Sadly, in time, the elves came to fight among themselves. In time, they came to look upon the cost of their battles to the world, and chose to withdraw, leaving the world in the hands of the younger races. </li>
<li>With that, began the <b>Age of Humans</b>, which ontinues to this day.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="educated_knowledge">What Some Know</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Dawn War (???) - Battles between the gods and the primordial titans, culminating in the <b>Age of Shadows</b></li>
<li>Days of Thunder ( ~ -35,000 DR to ~-30,000 DR) - Era of the "creator races", most of which have vanished to time, but were responsible for many of the Realms' species.</li>
<li>Dawn Age( ~ -30,000 DR to ~ -24,000 DR) - Era of giants and dragons, which were both even more powerful than they are today.  Eventually fell to the dragon's themselves.</li>
<li>First Flowering  ~ -24,000 DR to ~ -12,000 DR - emergence and rise  of the elf nations, who used powerful magics to keep the dragons from re-establishing themselves. </li>
<li>Crown Wars (~ -12,000 DR to ~ -9000 DR)</li> - 5 (arguably 6) wars among the elves. 
<li>The Founding Time( ~ -9000 DR to ~ -3000 DR)</li> Last age of the elven and dwarven empires as the human (and other) nations gained strength under their protection. 
<li>Age of Humanity ~ -3000 DR to Present* With the ascent of Netheril, the human nations took center stage, and held onto it through the collapse of Netheril.
<li>* Times of change, subject to some debate  - arguably beginning in either 1358DR (the Time of Troubles) or 1385DR (the Spellplague), and continuing through the modern day, some scholar assert these changes were so fundamental as to constitute transition to a new era.  Others argue that this is just grandstanding on the parts of historians looking to name a new era. </li>
</ul>
<ul>


  <h2 id="scholar_knowledge">What Scholar's Know</h2>
  <p>First answer: Not much, and they'll be the first to tell you this.  We're talking almost thirty two thousand years of potentially recorded history, but it's all staggeringly poorly documented. And what documentation there is tends to be staggeringly unreliable.  But what they <b>do</b> know is that almost everything that we "know" is grossly oversimplified. With that in mind, here are a few items that Scholars discuss.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>The Dawn War and the Age of Shadows</b>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The primary conflict was between the gods (who were tied to the astral sea and the outer planes) and the primoridals, also called "Dawn Titans", who were tied to the inner planes.
    </li>
    <li>The conventional distinction is that the gods were more "sophisticated" while the primoridals were closer to nature and more inclined towards entropy and destruction.  This distinction works in broad stroke, but has so many exceptions and caveats to very clearly be a narrative created by winners.</li>
    <li>During this era was a time referred to "The Blue Age", a time of a great deal of undersea life which ended with the age of shadows.</li>
    <li>Whether or not the sun was literally eaten, the  Shadow Epoch corresponded with a vast ice age covering the whole of the planet for an unknown amount of time.  </li>
    <li>By reports, the battle between gods & primordials continued through the Shadow Epoch, ableit at a slower pace. The final culmination of the era came with the primordial Ubtao (Father of Dionsaurs) betraying of the primordials. A new sun was created in response to this victory, allowing the ice caps to withdraw and the Age of Thunder to begin.</li>

  </ul></li>
  <li><b>The Age of Thunder</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The most contentious point of this era is who exactly constitutes the "creator races".  Northern academic canon states that they are the Sarukkh, The Batrachi, The Aearee, The Fey and the Humans, but this categorization does not hold up to much scrutiny.</li>
      <li>First and foremost, the humans that existed at this time were pre-technoligical hunters and gatherers, and had no accomplishments that merit their inclusion as a creator race, save for the fact that they wrote the histories.</li>
      <li>There is strong consensus on the inclusion off the Sarukkh and Batrachi as creator races, but that's about as far as consensus goes.</li>
      <li>So far as has been determined, the <b>Sarukkh</b> were the first creator race. They were saurians, and were the creators of many scalefolk (lizardmen, yaun-ti, and Naga, most ntoably). They are the most well known of the creator races, which is a strange sort of acclaim</li>
      <li>The Batrachi were an amphibious people whose rose coincided witht he decline of the Sarrukh empire, and their success kept the Yuan-Ti from succeeding their creators.  It's unclear why, but what accounts we have suggest they ended up in conflict with beings of great power (Titans, by some accounts) and unbound a number of primordials in response.  This, in turn, leads to dramatic, world changign levels of destruction and an event called "The Sundering", as well as leading to changes in climate that doomed the Batrachi.</li>
      <li>NB: The Batrachi had always been closely tied to chaos, and with the fall of their empire, it is well documented that much of the leadership withdrew to the plane of Limbo to establish a new home. IN doing so, they have managed to confuse centuries of scholars, due to the Batrachi's strong resemblance to Slaad, the natives of Limbo.</li>
      <li>The Batrachi were responsible for the creation of numerous amphibious races, like  bullywugs & Koua Toa, and also created numerous shapeshifting creature, including doppelgangers and mimics</li>
      <li><b>The Aearee</b> were an avian race, responsible for the creation of the aarokocra, the Kenku and other avian races.  While their accomplishments were similar to the Batrachi and Sarukkh, there is some contention regarding their inclusion a creator race because they came very late in the era.  However, this aregument doesn't really hold much water on its own, and is largely just used by people looking to find a way to argue that dragons or giants should also be categorized as creator races.</li>
      <li>It is generally acknowledged that <b>The Fey</b> had a substantial presence during this period, but some object ot their categorization as a "Creator" race because - unlike the Sarukkk, Bartachi and Aearee - they did not really have any sort of unified nation, and they did not "create" new races in the same way as the others.  Rather, many races (most notably, elves) were introduced to the Realms from the feywild, but whether that was intnetional or just a function of the Feywild's proximity is subject to debate.</li>
      <li>There will always be scholars arguing for the inclusion of Dragons or Giants on the list, of creator races.  Curiously, they have never gotten, much leeway because the arguments for both races are so similar, and most who have argued for the inclusion of one have adamantly refused the inclusion of the other. </li>
      <li>There were also numerous other intelligent races at the time, some in substantial numbers.  We have record of the existance of large nations of Tritons and Gnolls, if only because they fought against the creator races.</li>
      <li>Study of these races has been minimal over the years, in no small part because  proving that gnolls are more ancient than elves woudl be a great way to never get any funding ever again.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><B>The Sundering</B>
        <ul>
      <li>Very little is understood about The Sundering. In fact, by it's nature, it's somewhat difficult to prove it even happened, except by inference.</li>
      <li>Our best understanding is that as the war with the unleashed primordials escalated, it was ultimately resolved through the creation of another world for the primordials to claim (or to be banaished to, based on accounts).</li>
      <li>Credit for this action is generally given to Lord Ao, but that is also something of a non-answer by the academically minded.</li>
      <li>The mechanics of this are confusing.  A new world was created (somewhere) and things from Toril were sent there, but some may have been copied? And the seperation may not have been clear cut.  By some accounts, there has continued to be "slippage" between the two worlds since that day.</li>
      <li>There's enough evidence that this is true to accept the phenomena, but it probably doesn't happen nearly as often as it's invoked by scholars who use it to throw up their hands at confusing bits of historical record.</li>
    </ul>
  
  
  </li>
  <li><b>The Dawn Age</b>
  <ul>
    <li>This period is maddening to scholars because there's no shortage of evidence that it happened, but scarce evidence on how any of it <i>worked</i>.  The idea of dragon and giant empires clashing is striking and romantic, but starts getting a little shakey when you start trying to ask how such institutions were organized and administered </li>
    <li>One great mystery is the relative scarcity of archaeological record of the giants.  It's well known that Dragons rarely build, but a substantial population of giants should have left behind giant sized infrastructure.  And, yes, there are a handful of such ruins, there are far too few to account for the reported population.</li>
    <li>The conventional wisdom answer is "The dragons destroyed them all", and while that sounds tidy, it doesn't really hold up to much scrutiny</li>
    <li>During this period, most of the races were slaves (or livestock) to the dragons, giants or both. Yes, even the "good" dragons.</li>
  </ul>
