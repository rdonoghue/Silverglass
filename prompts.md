# Questions

These are questions that I'm hoping every player will answer to help drive play.

## Drive

You're playing pretty experienced adventureres. You could have retired, or have gotten a secure, safe job somewhere. But you haven't. Something keeps pushing you. What is it? What is the thing that draws you into adventures when no reasonable person would? Some possibilities:

Specifically, I'm looking for the button that I can press which results in action. Ya'll are fantasy fiction badasses, and you're not likely to be doing temp work for randos in a tavern. But since this is pick up, I want an easy handle for bad decisions, thus the question. Here are some possibilities:

Bad Luck - You are always one job away from being able to retire and settle down. You will never not be one job away from being able to retire and settle down.

Big Damn Hero - You're one of the good guys, and impossible as it is, you're going to make the world a better place.

Cursed - You've been cursed, and the details keep you in this life. What sort of curse is it?

Demonstration - have something to prove to someone who is deeply invested in not being impressed. What are you trying to prove, and why is it so damn hard?

Duty - You are not doing this as the behest of someone, rather, you are doing it for someone or something's _sake_. Who are they, and what is it they need that you can't ever fully provide, but by god you'll keep on trying.

Forgotten - You have lost your memory, and have no idea who you are or what you're doing. Snippets and visions occasionally pull you in strange directions, but the mystery only deepens.

Impostor - There is a hero whose story is too important to end. That's why you buried them in an unmarked grave and have carried on the legacy.

Loyalty - You aren't doing this for yourself, you're doing to for someone else. Who are they, and why do you do whatever they ask?

Mission - You have a job to finish or die trying. At this point, "die trying" is looking like the likelier outcome, but you've made your peace with that.

Poor Decision Making - What is says on the tin. There is no bad idea that's so bad you won't jump into it whole heartedly.

Pride - You are just that good, and it is unacceptable that anyone forget it.
Remember Me - Countless histories lie in the bones of the forgotten. It is important that, no matter what happens, the world knows who these heroes are, and you need to document them.

Revenge - SOmebody's going to pay

Thrill Seeking - Sure, you _could_ have a safe, well paying, secure job. You'd just be dead from boredom within the week.

Unwanted Destiny - You didn't ask for this.
