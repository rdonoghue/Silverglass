              Three times now, Shards has seen a handsome male Tabaxi, only
              slightly taller than her. The first time, as the Tomb of
              Nazil-Gahn was collapsing behind her, she saw him running out of
              another exit, on a hillside far away. The second time, in the
              jungles of Chult, he rode swiftly past on a dinosaur. More
              recently, she was sure she saw him as she was soundlessly moving
              through the streets of Beacon. He walked down the middle of the
              street like he owned it, his rapier flashing in the moonlight, his
              white fur almost glowing. In her mind, she calls him Ghost in the
              Moonlight, but she does not know who he is, where she could find
              him, if he is smart or funny, or if he is as fascinated with her
              as she is with him.
