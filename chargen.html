        <h1>Character Creation</h1>
        <h2>Stats</h2>
        <p>Starting stats: 16, 12 17, 14, 17, 11 (yes, they are egregiously good. Thank Jenna)</p>
        <h2>Race, Class and Level</h2>
        <p>Characters will be starting at level 15 and be limited to martial classes only (Fighter, Rogue, Barbarian, Monk). This is a pretty serious constraint, and some amount of class overlap is unavoidable, so simply don’t stress it.</p>
        <p> Characters can be of any race, but the weirder it is, the more implicit problems it's going to have.</p>
        <h2>Backgrounds</h2>
        <ul>
<li>Backgrounds from Spelljammer, Strixhaven, Dragonlance, Planescape and Ravnica are not allowed.</li>
<li>We're not using the Baldur's Gate backgrounds to simplify bookeeping, but most backgrounds will work more like their BG counterparts</li>
<li>Wildermont backgrounds won't work as written, but can be tweaked.</li>
<li>Otherwise, we're good</li>
<li>Every character may pick one additional feat as part of their background.  It's expected that the chosen feat lines up the background.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h2>Feats</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Feats from Spelljammer, Strixhaven, Dragonlance, Planescape and Ravnica are off the table</li>
          <li>Feats that grant additional spells are subject to some restrictions.  Ones which give natural abilities that use spell effects are acceptable, but straight up spells are not.</li>
          <li>The more magical the feat, the more implicit setting hooks they have.  For example, a Fey Touched characters is going to be known as Fey Touched, and find themselves frequently drawn into Fey matters.</li>
          <li>The exception is that Ritual Magic is explicitly available.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Money</h2>
        You're broke.  Don't sweat it. 
        <h2>Starting Equipment</h2>
        <p>Characters can have any mundane equipment, and start play with a set of magic items.</p>

            <p>This is largely unbounded, within the theme of the game. Which is to say, no Staff’s of the Archmagi or things that woudl similarly bring in heavy spellcasting, but beyond that, any rarity up to and including artifacts is allowed, with some caveats. These will require discussion with the GM, and for things like Artifacts, there will unquestionably be in-game strings attached. The goal here is to enable one cool thing.</p>
            <p>If the one cool thing you want doesn’t really have a good option, then we can discuss customization, no problem.</p>
            <p>If the one cool thing has some other constraints that make this impractical, we can make other adjustments. For example, one player has chosen a Hammer of Thunderbolts as their signature item, which requires other magic items for its use. We’re altering the item list for that character to enable the signature, since that’s the priority.</p>
