        <h1>Character Creation</h1>
        <h2>Stats</h2>
        <p>Starting stats: 16, 12 17, 14, 17, 11 (yes, they are egregiously good. Thank Jenna)</p>
        <h2>Race, Class and Level</h2>
        <p>Characters will be starting at level 15 and be limited to martial classes only (Fighter, Rogue, Barbarian, Monk). This is a pretty serious constraint, and some amount of class overlap is unavoidable, so simply don’t stress it.</p>
        <p> Characters can be of any race, but the weirder it is, the more implicit problems it's going to have.</p>
        <h2>Backgrounds</h2>
        <ul>
<li>Backgrounds from Spelljammer, Strixhaven, Dragonlance, Planescape and Ravnica are not allowed.</li>
<li>We're not using the Baldur's Gate backgrounds to simplify bookeeping, but most backgrounds will work more like their BG counterparts</li>
<li>Wildermont backgrounds won't work as written, but can be tweaked.</li>
<li>Otherwise, we're good</li>
<li>Every character may pick one additional feat as part of their background.  It's expected that the chosen feat lines up the background.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h2>Feats</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Feats from Spelljammer, Strixhaven, Dragonlance, Planescape and Ravnica are off the table</li>
          <li>Feats that grant additional spells are subject to some restrictions.  Ones which give natural abilities that use spell effects are acceptable, but straight up spells are not.</li>
          <li>The more magical the feat, the more implicit setting hooks they have.  For example, a Fey Touched characters is going to be known as Fey Touched, and find themselves frequently drawn into Fey matters.</li>
          <li>The exception is that Ritual Magic is explicitly available.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Money</h2>
        You're broke.  Don't sweat it. 
        <h2>Starting Equipment</h2>
        <p>Characters can have any mundane equipment, and start play with a set of magic items.</p>
        <div class="col3">
          <div class="col">
            <div class="highlightbox">Two +1 items</div>
            <p>The following keywords can be swapped in for a +1</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Adamantine (Weapon or armor)</p></li>
        <li><p>Mariner (Armor)</p></li>
        <li><p>Hellfire (Weapon)</p></li>
        <li><p>Mithral (Armor)</p></li>
        <li><p>Sentinel (Shield)</p></li>
        <li><p>Serpent Scale (Scale Mail Armor)</p></li>
        <li><p>Returning (Thrown Weapons)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>To be clear, this is explicitly limited to items that just provide a +1, not things which do other things and also just happen to provide a +1.  This explicitly excludes many items, even ones that might normally be common in D&D.</p>
        <p>Additional note: "Warning" is not on this list, and its exclusion is deliberate.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col"> 
            <div class="highlightbox">One +2 item</div>

            <li><p>Acheron (Weapon)</p></li>
            <li><p>Resistance (Armor)</p></li>
            <li><p>Battering (Shield)</p></li>
            <li><p>Corpse Slayer (Weapon)</p></li>
            <li><p>Crystal Blade (Weapon)</p></li>

            <li><p>Dragon Wing (Bow)</p></li>
            <li><p>Flame Tongue (Weapon)</p></li>
            <li><p>Gambler’s (Weapon)</p></li>
            <li><p>Giant Slayer (Weapon)</p></li>
            <li><p>Glamoured (Studded Leather)</p></li>
            <li><p>Disruption (mace)</p></li>
            <li><p>Smiting (Bludgeoning weapon)</p></li>
            <li><p>Life Stealing (weapon)</p></li>
            <li><p>Wounding (weapon)</p></li>
            <li><p>Vicious (weapon)</p></li>
            <li><p>Woodcutter (Axe)</p></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <div class="highlightbox">One 'signature' item</div>
            <p>This is largely unbounded, within the theme of the game. Which is to say, no Staff’s of the Archmagi or things that woudl similarly bring in heavy spellcasting, but beyond that, any rarity up to and including artifacts is allowed, with some caveats. These will require discussion with the GM, and for things like Artifacts, there will unquestionably be in-game strings attached. The goal here is to enable one cool thing.</p>
            <p>If the one cool thing you want doesn’t really have a good option, then we can discuss customization, no problem.</p>
            <p>If the one cool thing has some other constraints that make this impractical, we can make other adjustments. For example, one player has chosen a Hammer of Thunderbolts as their signature item, which requires other magic items for its use. We’re altering the item list for that character to enable the signature, since that’s the priority.</p>

        <h1>Drives</h1>
        <p>
          Drive: You're playing pretty experienced adventureres.  You could have retired, or have gotten a secure, safe job somewhere.  But you haven't.  Something keeps pushing you.  What is it? What is the thing that draws you into adventures when no reasonable person would?  </p>
          <p>
          Specifically, I'm looking for the button that I can press which results in action. Ya'll are fantasy fiction badasses, and you're not likely to be doing temp work for randos in a tavern. But since this is pick up, I want an easy handle for bad decisions, thus the question. Here are some possibilities:
        </p>
        <p>
          Some possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loyalty - You aren't doing this for yourself, you're doing to for someone else. Who are they, and why do you do whatever they ask?</li><li>
Duty - You are not doing this as the behest of someone, rather, you are doing it for someone or something's *sake*. Who are they, and what is it they need that you can't ever fully provide, but by god you'll keep on trying.</li><li>
Revenge - SOmebody's going to pay</li><li>
Demonstration - have something to prove to someone who is deeply invested in not being impressed. What are you trying to prove, and why is it so damn hard?</li><li>
Pride - You are just that good, and it is unacceptable that anyone forget it.</li><li>
Poor Decision Making - What is says on the tin. There is no bad idea that's so bad you won't jump into it whole heartedly.</li><li>
Thrill Seeking - Sure, you *could* have a safe, well paying, secure job. You'd just be dead from boredom within the week.</li><li>
Big Damn Hero - You're one of the good guys, and impossible as it is, you're going to make the world a better place.</li><li>
Bad Luck - You are always one job away from being able to retire and settle down. You will never not be one job away from being able to retire and settle down.</li><li>
Mission - You have a job to finish or die trying. At this point, "die trying" is looking like the likelier outcome, but you've made your peace with that.</li><li>
Unwanted Destiny - You didn't ask for this.</li><li>
Remember Me - Countless histories lie in the bones of the forgotten. It is important that, no matter what happens, the world knows who these heroes are, and you need to document them.</li><li>
Impostor - There is a hero whose story is too important to end. That's why you buried them in an unmarked grave and have carried on the legacy.</li><li>
Forgotten - You have lost your memory, and have no idea who you are or what you're doing. Snippets and visions occasionally pull you in strange directions, but the mystery only deepens. </li><li>
Cursed - You've been cursed, and the details keep you in this life.  What sort of curse is it?</li>
</ul>
