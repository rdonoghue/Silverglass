<h1>Fireside</h1>
<p>
  Class is of tremendous importance in Fireside, and the nature of class
  strongly favors the Genasi. Within skyfire, the pecking order is:
</p>
<p>
  At the top of all things, are the genie. They are the absolute rulers of the
  Emirates, but even so, they are far from numerous. The simple truth is that
  only so many genie are that interested in a relatively backwater world. The
  genie themselves have an incredibly elaborate system of position and privilege
  which changes and evolves over time. As this cycle changes, so does the
  prevalence of different types of genie in the Emirates.
</p>
<p>
  Within Fireside, the chief figure is the <b>Sovereign</b>, the enigmatic ruler
  of the city whose identity is a closely guarded secret. Some even suspect that
  the title changes hands with some frequency, based upon elemental politics,
  but there's no proof to back up that suspicion. The Sovereign's title does not
  exist in the Skyfire Emirates, but it equates to at least a very highly ranked
  Pasha, though some suspect that the Sovereign is a genie in disguise
</p>
<p>
  The next rank down are the <b>pasha</b>, sometimes called greater genasi.
  Bloodline purity is of tremendous importance to many pasha, as it serves as a
  measure of their proximity to genie-kind, and in turn, of their own
  importance. Predictably, this means there is an elaborate pecking order among
  the pasha which is a reflection of the politics among the genie. It is
  possible for a prominent bey, or a powerful elemental ally to be recognized as
  a pasha, and such figures are treated with respect for their personal power,
  but they are towards the bottom of the overall pasha oeder of things. Still,
  the least of the pasha still has access to more power and wealth than most can
  dream of.
</p>
<p>
  Beneath them are the <b>bey</b>, often viewed as the true 'citizens' of the
  emirates, as they have many protected rights, including those of property
  ownership. To be a bey is not the same guarantee of earthly success that being
  a pasha is, but it still offers a substantial head start. The vast majority of
  bey are genasi, and genasi blood is one path to guarantee bey status. A small
  number of bey are non-genasi who have been rewarded for exceptional service.
  Such bey are granted a plaque of office, and woe unto the bey who loses
  theirs, for it will not be replaced.
</p>
<p>
  Beneath the bey are the bulk of the population, the <b>nabob</b>. The is a
  term generally used to describe all of those without elemental blood. While
  the term is not an insult (and there absolutely are insulting version of it),
  it's connotations are...not great.
</p>
<p>
  Informally, the nabob are divided into man distinctions, the two most common
  being <b>celeb</b> and <b>kir</b>. Celeb are those nabob who bring value to
  the Emirates, such as skilled craftsmen or soldiers. Kir are those nabob who
  are seen as a drain upon the emirates - that is to say, the poor and criminal
  - and that term is absolutely an insult.
