        <h1 id="history">History</h1>
        <p>
          Technically, it’s two cities -
          <b
            >The Grand Revived Free City of Sudlophor, Reborn in the Glory of
            the Everlasting Flame</b
          >
          to the west and <b>Novo Argentium</b> to the east. That’s a mouthful,
          and it is most commonly shortened to Silverglass in reflection of the
          iconic towers that represent each city. The cities lie on opposite
          sides of the straights that connect the Shining Sea to the "Lake" of
          Steam (Actually an inland saltwater sea). Both are fairly young
          cities, built after the Lake of Steam's level rose back to it's
          previous levels, and while the geography of the area has changed,
          ruins from the old cities are a part of the landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          The western city, called "Fireside" by occupants unbound by formality,
          is nominally a free city ruled by its Sovereign out of the
          multi-colored Tower of Glass. In practice, it is accepted that the
          Sovereign is a puppet of the Skyfire Emirates, with just enough of a
          fig leaf of independence to provide the Emirates insulation from the
          consequences of their expansionist tendencies. Fireside is divided
          into an inner and outer city. The inner city is a genuine wonder,
          constructed by the many elementals "on loan" from the Emirates. While
          it sees regular trade and traffic, the only permanent residents are
          those highly ranked - the Genasi, Greater genasi and highly ranked
          mortals. Some Jinnfolk are also said to maintain residences in the
          city, but such matters are closely held secrets. The outer city,
          beyond the gates, it rather less spectacular, and serves as a home for
          those below the Pasha's and Beys of the Inner city.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a little more debate about how the eastern city, got the name
          "Silverside". It is most commonly attributed to the
          <b>Silverlight</b>, an immense lighthouse, visible far out into the
          silver sea. However, there is also a persistent rumor that The
          Protector is a disguised silver dragon. If true, the Protector isn't
          being subtle about it, incorporating silver dragons into her coat of
          arms and the decorations of Silverhold. While the Protector's informal
          authority goes largely unchallenged, the day to day ruling of the city
          lies in the hands of a council whose seats align with the factions and
          powers who sponsored the development of the city. While these factions
          were unified in their desire to not hand control of the neck over to
          the Skyfire Emirates, their politics do not otherwise tend to overlap.
        </p>

        <h1>Fireside</h1>
        <p>
          Class is of tremendous importance in Fireside, and the nature of class
          strongly favors the Genasi. Within skyfire, the pecking order is:
        </p>
        <p>
          At the top of all things, are the genie. They are the absolute rulers
          of the Emirates, but even so, they are far from numerous. The simple
          truth is that only so many genie are that interested in a relatively
          backwater world. The genie themselves have an incredibly elaborate
          system of position and privilege which changes and evolves over time.
          As this cycle changes, so does the prevalence of different types of
          genie in the Emirates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within Fireside, the chief figure is the <b>Sovereign</b>, the
          enigmatic ruler of the city whose identity is a closely guarded
          secret. Some even suspect that the title changes hands with some
          frequency, based upon elemental politics, but there's no proof to back
          up that suspicion. The Sovereign's title does not exist in the Skyfire
          Emirates, but it equates to at least a very highly ranked Pasha,
          though some suspect that the Sovereign is a genie in disguise
        </p>
        <p>
          The next rank down are the <b>pasha</b>, sometimes called greater
          genasi. Bloodline purity is of tremendous importance to many pasha, as
          it serves as a measure of their proximity to genie-kind, and in turn,
          of their own importance. Predictably, this means there is an elaborate
          pecking order among the pasha which is a reflection of the politics
          among the genie. It is possible for a prominent bey, or a powerful
          elemental ally to be recognized as a pasha, and such figures are
          treated with respect for their personal power, but they are towards
          the bottom of the overall pasha oeder of things. Still, the least of
          the pasha still has access to more power and wealth than most can
          dream of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beneath them are the <b>bey</b>, often viewed as the true 'citizens'
          of the emirates, as they have many protected rights, including those
          of property ownership. To be a bey is not the same guarantee of
          earthly success that being a pasha is, but it still offers a
          substantial head start. The vast majority of bey are genasi, and
          genasi blood is one path to guarantee bey status. A small number of
          bey are non-genasi who have been rewarded for exceptional service.
          Such bey are granted a plaque of office, and woe unto the bey who
          loses theirs, for it will not be replaced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beneath the bey are the bulk of the population, the <b>nabob</b>. The
          is a term generally used to describe all of those without elemental
          blood. While the term is not an insult (and there absolutely are
          insulting version of it), it's connotations are...not great.
        </p>
        <p>
          Informally, the nabob are divided into man distinctions, the two most
          common being <b>celeb</b> and <b>kir</b>. Celeb are those nabob who
          bring value to the Emirates, such as skilled craftsmen or soldiers.
          Kir are those nabob who are seen as a drain upon the emirates - that
          is to say, the poor and criminal - and that term is absolutely an
          insult.

        <p>
          If a visitor has come to Fireside, they have come to see Bomo, a
          renown center of arts, music, crafts, food and theater
        </p>
        <h2 id="#cistern">Cistern</h2>
        <p>
          Named for the towering water supply for the city, this neighborhood is
          populated primarily by the Beys of the city.

        <h2 id="#fishbone">Fishbone</h2>
        <p>
          A robust fish harbor that provides much of the food for Fireside.
          Populated by Nabob, the smell of fish is still better than the smell
          of the Garden.
        </p>

        <h2 id="#firewall">Firewall</h2>
        <p>
          Surrounded by the eponymous wall, this incredibly exclusive
          neighborhood is the Domain of the Sovereign and their most favored
          pashas.
        </p>
        <h2 id="#garden">The Garden</h2>
        <p>
          Cramped, chaotic, rich and wretched in equal parts, this is the
          neighborhood where most of the cities nabob are forced to live.
        </p>
        <h2 id="#koyun">Koyun</h2>

        </p>
        <h2 id="#maze">The Maze</h2>
        <p>
          Used by the sovereign for gruesome punishments, it is known to ignore
          the sounds the come from within. Tellingly, the only good view of what
          happens in the maze is from the Tower of Glass.
        </p>
        <h2 id="#sirki">Sirki</h2>
        <p>
          Elite neighborhood of the pasha. usually quiet and serene, The

        <h2 id="#glasstower">Tower of Glass</h2>
        <p>
          An immense tower which appears to be made of a single piece of
          multicolored glass which shifts over time. Home to the sovereign and
          the city administration.

        <p>
          <b>The Koru</b> - Fireside does not have a dedicated police
          organization, and they partner with Silverside's Hunter's Guild for
          most such responsibilities, but they also rely on a collection of
          animated statues, called "Koru", who tirelessly patrol the streets of
          the city. While their routes are largely planned out, the are varied
          enough to keep from being too predictable, and the koru posess enough
          intelligence and initiaitve to mix things up a little. This
          intelligence also allows them to answer simple question, provide
          directions and generally be helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exact mechanics behind the Koru are a mystery, though it's
          understood that they respond to the Soveriegn's command. They also
          speak with a single voice in a manner that suggests they may share
          some amount of awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a small administrative group responsible for the upkeep and
          maintenence of the Koru, and it includes a small number of "Koru"
          officers, who have the authority to order units of Koru in situations
          which merit a better understanding.
        </p>
        <h1>Silverside</h1>
        <p>
          While Silverside is more of a free city than Fireside, that is not a
          result of a lack of outside influence so much as it is a lack of
          agreement among those outside influences. The council which rules the
          city represents interests from Tethyr, The Border Kingdome, The
          Steamlake Alliance, Chult and (nominally) Halruua, with other minor
          powers have presences as well. The presence of the city itself is
          almost an afterthought.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this is not the most stable of situations, it's driven by the
          necessity that Novo Argentium remain a genuinely free city - should
          any one councilmember take too strong a position, the expectation is
          that the Emirates would seize upon this "imperial aggression" and take
          it upon themselves to "liberate" the city.
