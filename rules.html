          <h1 id="chargen">Character Creation</h1>
          <h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>
          <p>
            Starting stats: 16, 12 17, 14, 17, 11 (yes, they are egregiously
            good. Thank Jenna)
          </p>
          <h2 id="race">Race, Class and Level</h2>
          <p>
            Characters will be starting at level 15 and be limited to martial
            classes only (Fighter, Rogue, Barbarian, Monk). This is a pretty
            serious constraint, and some amount of class overlap is unavoidable,
            so simply don’t stress it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Characters can be of any race, but the weirder it is, the more
            implicit problems it's going to have.
          </p>
          <h2 id="backgrounds">Backgrounds</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Backgrounds from Spelljammer, Strixhaven, Dragonlance, Planescape
              and Ravnica are not allowed.
            </li>
            <li>
              We're not using the Baldur's Gate backgrounds to simplify
              bookeeping, but most backgrounds will work more like their BG
              counterparts
            </li>
            <li>
              Wildermont backgrounds won't work as written, but can be tweaked.
            </li>
            <li>Otherwise, we're good</li>
            <li>
              Every character may pick one additional feat as part of their
              background. It's expected that the chosen feat lines up the
              background.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="feats">Feats</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Feats from Spelljammer, Strixhaven, Dragonlance, Planescape and
              Ravnica are off the table
            </li>
            <li>
              Feats that grant additional spells are subject to some
              restrictions. Ones which give natural abilities that use spell
              effects are acceptable, but straight up spells are not.
            </li>
            <li>
              The more magical the feat, the more implicit setting hooks they
              have. For example, a Fey Touched characters is going to be known
              as Fey Touched, and find themselves frequently drawn into Fey
              matters.
            </li>
            <li>The exception is that Ritual Magic is explicitly available.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="money">Money</h2>
          You're broke. Don't sweat it.
          <h2 id="gear">Starting Equipment</h2>
          <p>
            Characters can have any mundane equipment, and start play with a set
            of magic items.
          </p>
          <div class="col3">
            <div class="col">
              <div class="highlightbox">Two +1 items</div>
              <p>The following keywords can be swapped in for a +1</p>
              <ul>
                <li><p>Adamantine (Weapon or armor)</p></li>
                <li><p>Mariner (Armor)</p></li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                To be clear, this is explicitly limited to items that just
                provide a +1, not things which do other things and also just
                happen to provide a +1. This explicitly excludes many items,
                even ones that might normally be common in D&D.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additional note: "Warning" is not on this list, and its
                exclusion is deliberate.

            <div class="col">
              <div class="highlightbox">One 'signature' item</div>
              <p>
                This is largely unbounded, within the theme of the game. Which
                is to say, no Staff’s of the Archmagi or things that woudl
                similarly bring in heavy spellcasting, but beyond that, any
                rarity up to and including artifacts is allowed, with some
                caveats. These will require discussion with the GM, and for
                things like Artifacts, there will unquestionably be in-game
                strings attached. The goal here is to enable one cool thing.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the one cool thing you want doesn’t really have a good
                option, then we can discuss customization, no problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the one cool thing has some other constraints that make this
                impractical, we can make other adjustments. For example, one
                player has chosen a Hammer of Thunderbolts as their signature
                item, which requires other magic items for its use. We’re
                altering the item list for that character to enable the
                signature, since that’s the priority.

          <h1 id="drives">Drives</h1>
          <p>
            Drive: You're playing pretty experienced adventureres. You could
            have retired, or have gotten a secure, safe job somewhere. But you
            haven't. Something keeps pushing you. What is it? What is the thing
            that draws you into adventures when no reasonable person would?
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifically, I'm looking for the button that I can press which
            results in action. Ya'll are fantasy fiction badasses, and you're
            not likely to be doing temp work for randos in a tavern. But since
            this is pick up, I want an easy handle for bad decisions, thus the
            question. Here are some possibilities:
          </p>
          <p>Some possibilities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Loyalty - You aren't doing this for yourself, you're doing to for
              someone else. Who are they, and why do you do whatever they ask?
            </li>
            <li>
              Duty - You are not doing this as the behest of someone, rather,
              you are doing it for someone or something's *sake*. Who are they,
              and what is it they need that you can't ever fully provide, but by
              god you'll keep on trying.
            </li>
            <li>Revenge - SOmebody's going to pay</li>
            <li>
              Demonstration - have something to prove to someone who is deeply
              invested in not being impressed. What are you trying to prove, and
              why is it so damn hard?
            </li>
            <li>
              Pride - You are just that good, and it is unacceptable that anyone
              forget it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Poor Decision Making - What is says on the tin. There is no bad
              idea that's so bad you won't jump into it whole heartedly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Thrill Seeking - Sure, you *could* have a safe, well paying,
              secure job. You'd just be dead from boredom within the week.
            </li>
            <li>
              Big Damn Hero - You're one of the good guys, and impossible as it
              is, you're going to make the world a better place.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bad Luck - You are always one job away from being able to retire
              and settle down. You will never not be one job away from being
              able to retire and settle down.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mission - You have a job to finish or die trying. At this point,
              "die trying" is looking like the likelier outcome, but you've made
              your peace with that.
            </li>
            <li>Unwanted Destiny - You didn't ask for this.</li>
            <li>
              Remember Me - Countless histories lie in the bones of the
              forgotten. It is important that, no matter what happens, the world
              knows who these heroes are, and you need to document them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Impostor - There is a hero whose story is too important to end.
              That's why you buried them in an unmarked grave and have carried
              on the legacy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Forgotten - You have lost your memory, and have no idea who you
              are or what you're doing. Snippets and visions occasionally pull
              you in strange directions, but the mystery only deepens.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cursed - You've been cursed, and the details keep you in this
              life. What sort of curse is it?
            </li>
          </ul>

              <p>
                Koyu are animated statues who serve as watchmen and guides on
                the streets of Fireside. They mostly walk well established
                routes, but have enough intelligence and initiative to vary it
                somewhat. This intlligence is also sufficient to allow them to
                answer simple questions, and while they're helpful in intent,
                their knowledge of things outside of giving directions is rather
                lacking.
              </p>
              <p>
                While they can fight, they focus on capturing targets. The usual
                approach is for one Koyu to immobilize the target and allow
                other Koyou to carry both of them off if needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Koyu take their direction from the Soveriegn, but they will
                attempt to follow commands from Pashas and other people of
                apparent report, so long as those order don't seem too contrary
                to their jobs. There are also a small number of "officers"
                responsible for the administration of the Koyu who can also
                command them.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a great many theories about exactly how many Koyu are
                in service in the city, but the actual number is a well
                protected secret

                A blue lacquer full face mask with stars on is surface. The
                stars move in alignment with the heavens, and tend to flare for
                dramatic effect. It is the mask of a hero of the Genasi, an air
                blood named Azim, and is easily recognized throughout the
                Skyfire Emirates.
              </p>
              <p>
                While wearing the mask, the welder is Azim as far as the
                universe is concerned. Any divination or similar magic will
                reveal that they are a male air genasi named Azim Starblood.
                Even when not supplemented with additional effects, such as the
                masks alter self ability, it will generally seem utterly
                impossible that the wearer could be Azim, or that Azim could be
                the wearer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The masks has 7 charges, which replenish at dawn, and allows the
                weirder to cast the following spells:
              </p>
              <p>
                Levitate: At will<br />
                Alter Self: At Will<br />
                Gust of Wind: 1 Charge<br />
                Warding Wind: 1 Charges<br />
                Control Winds:: 3 charges<br />
                Investiture of Winds: 4 charges<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                It also grants double proficiency to all acrobatics and
                persuasion rolls.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, while wearing the mask, the welder is always
                surrounded by favorable winds. These don't have a substantial
                effect, but they guarantee that things flare dramatically at the
                right moments, and that the characters voice carries with
                appropriate drama when necessary.
              </p>
              <p>
                The mask has no strap or means to attach to the head, but
                instead simply stays on out of heroic affinity with the wearer.
                Should the wearer close to use the mask in an unheroic manner,
                then it will fall off.
