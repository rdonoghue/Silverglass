              Fabien basically Inigo Montoya'ed himself with a self-promise to
              one day take care of that. Off to study. Learned some sneaky
              damned assissing stuff in the Feywild for a time, but some
              material plane job (to be named as story), got him noticed by one
              of the governments (Leaving which one to you, if helpful). Trained
              further as solo sort of operative. Basically a history of getting
              some of the best possible training for years to turn him into a
              very specific sort of killing monster that ideally nobody ever
              sees coming. He has since left the job, although, nobody every
              truly gets "out" of the business.

                    What do you do when you’re not adventuring?<br />
                    Fabien bounces around to various normal odd jobs to get
                    cash. Things that don't show off his skills, like working as
                    a dock hand, or a dish washer. Average punch-clock joe
                    stuff.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Why is that not what you do all the time?<br />
                    He maintains a low profile to avoid former handlers looking
                    to drag him back for one more job, or in case he's ever
                    burned and some former victims come looking. He's trained in
                    how to stay off the radar, so he's not taking home prize
                    money from archery contests. He also keeps an ear to the
                    ground in case any word pops up about his lifelong target.
                    <br />
                    Previous career set him up with enough gear that he could
                    sell and retire in comfort. But he needs to stay sharp just
                    in case. He might get a revenge lead that would cause him to
                    just walk off a job and leave the city for a bit, or go on a
                    stakeout, or whatever. So far, they've all turned up to be
                    useless, and he shows back up at some other job. He also
                    just can't say no to family, and the few close friends might
                    as well be family.. See #4, #5 for more detail).

                  <li>
                    Why would you make a bad decision?<br />Aside from his own
                    revenge. Going freelance, and keeping an ear out in low
                    places means he hears stories. Stories about people who have
                    been wronged. The sort of people who just won't ever be in a
                    position to do something about it. Fabien is a sucker for
                    nearly anyone with the right sad story. Some son or daughter
                    who's poor father was imprisoned for some imagined insult to
                    a noble? He'll take that job pro-bono. They don't always end
                    in murder. Sometimes a creative punishment is more fitting,
                    but it's coming. That's what he's willing to risk exposure
                    for. That and…
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Name one person you’d go out on a limb for<br />Jax for
                    sure. We are actual brothers rather than just
                    Harengon-related. Fabien is a bit older, but may appear the
                    same age or younger due to some number of material-plane
                    years in the Feywild. Presuming time is similarly skewed.
                    But he has a brother, who sometimes needs a hand, or a
                    little help. Additionally, Fabien is slow to trust, and add
                    friends. Once he does though, he considers them chosen
                    family and will also easily drop anything short of his
                    personal mission to help them out.

              Commander Skend has fought for years along the borders of Tethyr
              to keep the expansionist aims of the Emirates in check, a part of
              his wider philosophy of ensuring autonomy throughout the region.
              While he is not a Knight of Tethyr, he maintains close ties with
              them. Tethyr has found his aid useful to be sure, though his lack
              of knightly principles has sometimes been a complicator—and
              sometimes an advantage. Now in Silverglass, he occasionally
              exchanges favors with the Tethyr faction of the Silverside
              Council.

                    What do you do when you’re not adventuring?<br />In terms of
                    employment, Garak is in “private security services”, mainly
                    for Silverside concerns. It’s gig work (more in #3), and a
                    lot of its challenges get solved without violence (there’s a
                    reason he’s proficient in three core social skills). He’s
                    also a “friend of the neighborhood” to a few areas in
                    Silverside, especially where he lives; in particular he’s
                    known to a few street performers who know he’s a reliable
                    talent at playing the straight man to their japery, and his
                    presence helps to draw the passing eye to their
                    performances.

                  <li>
                    Why is that not what you do all the time?<br />Professionally,
                    Skend has a particular set of skills for particular
                    situations, but the need for someone at his level very much
                    ebbs and flows. So sometimes he’s just not under contract.
                    Other times he lets his sense of right & wrong get in the
                    way of doing something for money, though experience has
                    tempered that a bit. Considering that it’s his military
                    career that’s the main part of why he’s a level 15
                    character, that experience runs deep and with a fair bit of
                    history, and sometimes tells him it’s better to walk away
                    than get involved. Sometimes he even listens.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Why would you make a bad decision?<br />The Emirates are
                    involved and up to no good like usual, or the people’s
                    freedoms are on the line! Sometimes that’s the same thing.

                  <li>
                    Name one person you’d go out on a limb for<br />Just one?<br />
                    If it’s just one, then we should talk about Janararanmujan
                    Halasaphyrii (familiar friends call her Janara and so can
                    you), a former Knight of Tethyr who has a relationship with
                    the Silverside Council (and who may have been an old flame,
                    but Garak does not confirm this). She’s got Garak’s number
                    and knows how to press those buttons in #4 if she’s looking
                    to get him under contract for a bit of Council business.<br />

                    player of Sandy Bottom’s Perfect Idiots, a street

                    to Garak showing up, and who Garak has used as some
