              Fabien basically Inigo Montoya'ed himself with a self-promise to
              one day take care of that. Off to study. Learned some sneaky
              damned assissing stuff in the Feywild for a time, but some
              material plane job (to be named as story), got him noticed by one
              of the governments (Leaving which one to you, if helpful). Trained
              further as solo sort of operative. Basically a history of getting
              some of the best possible training for years to turn him into a
              very specific sort of killing monster that ideally nobody ever
              sees coming. He has since left the job, although, nobody every
              truly gets "out" of the business.

                    <h3>What do you do when you’re not adventuring?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Fabien bounces around to various normal odd jobs to get
                      cash. Things that don't show off his skills, like working
                      as a dock hand, or a dish washer. Average punch-clock joe
                      stuff.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <div>

                    <p>
                      He maintains a low profile to avoid former handlers
                      looking to drag him back for one more job, or in case he's
                      ever burned and some former victims come looking. He's
                      trained in how to stay off the radar, so he's not taking
                      home prize money from archery contests. He also keeps an
                      ear to the ground in case any word pops up about his
                      lifelong target.

                    <p>
                      Previous career set him up with enough gear that he could
                      sell and retire in comfort. But he needs to stay sharp
                      just in case. He might get a revenge lead that would cause
                      him to just walk off a job and leave the city for a bit,
                      or go on a stakeout, or whatever. So far, they've all
                      turned up to be useless, and he shows back up at some
                      other job. He also just can't say no to family, and the
                      few close friends might as well be family.. See #4, #5 for
                      more detail).

                    <h3>Why would you make a bad decision?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Aside from his own revenge. Going freelance, and keeping
                      an ear out in low places means he hears stories. Stories
                      about people who have been wronged. The sort of people who
                      just won't ever be in a position to do something about it.
                      Fabien is a sucker for nearly anyone with the right sad
                      story. Some son or daughter who's poor father was
                      imprisoned for some imagined insult to a noble? He'll take
                      that job pro-bono. They don't always end in murder.
                      Sometimes a creative punishment is more fitting, but it's
                      coming. That's what he's willing to risk exposure for.
                      That and…
                    </p>

                      Fabien is slow to trust, and add friends. Once he does
                      though, he considers them chosen family and will also
                      easily drop anything short of his personal mission to help
                      them out.

              Drive: Duty (Containment)<br />Hailing from the Border Kingdoms,
              Commander Skend has fought for years along the borders of Tethyr
              to keep the expansionist aims of the Emirates in check, a part of
              his wider philosophy of ensuring autonomy throughout the region.
              While he is not a Knight of Tethyr, he maintains close ties with
              them. Tethyr has found his aid useful to be sure, though his lack
              of knightly principles has sometimes been a complicator—and
              sometimes an advantage. Now in Silverglass, he occasionally
              exchanges favors with the Tethyr faction of the Silverside
              Council.

                    <p>What do you do when you’re not adventuring?<br />In terms of
                      employment, Garak is in “private security services”, mainly
                      for Silverside concerns. It’s gig work (more in #3), and a
                      lot of its challenges get solved without violence (there’s a
                      reason he’s proficient in three core social skills). He’s
                      also a “friend of the neighborhood” to a few areas in
                      Silverside, especially where he lives; in particular he’s
                      known to a few street performers who know he’s a reliable
                      talent at playing the straight man to their japery, and his
                      presence helps to draw the passing eye to their

                    <p>Why is that not what you do all the time?<br />Professionally,
                      Skend has a particular set of skills for particular
                      situations, but the need for someone at his level very much
                      ebbs and flows. So sometimes he’s just not under contract.
                      Other times he lets his sense of right & wrong get in the
                      way of doing something for money, though experience has
                      tempered that a bit. Considering that it’s his military
                      career that’s the main part of why he’s a level 15
                      character, that experience runs deep and with a fair bit of
                      history, and sometimes tells him it’s better to walk away
                      than get involved. Sometimes he even listens.</p>

              The past is full of wonders and dangers, but that information can
              help us in the present to heal the world. Raised in a
              Chultan-Mulhorand family of traveling archeologists, Shards has
              quested for knowledge and to return ancient artifacts to their
              rightful inheritors - except to people like the Thay, screw those
              guys. But then her life's work, and spending time with her friends
              and family, was derailed by bonding with an artifact that has
              other plans...
            </li>
            <li class="drive">
              Drive: Unwanted Destiny.<br />
              Without that, she’d be a Big Damn Hero, but in a scholarly,
              archeological, thieving sort of way. The Key has a plan. It must
              open things, and so she must open those things. It was easier when
              she was younger and more foolish: she’d always hated locked and
              closed doors, boxes, chests…but the key makes it a compulsion,
              until it has been fully assembled, and can unlock whatever it is
              meant to free. She has had it long enough to know the consequences
              for being attuned to the Key can sometimes outweigh its benefits.
              To be honest, she sometimes takes what she hopes are beneficial
              thieving jobs (steal from bad guys) because otherwise the Key
              makes her antsy. Shards hopes whatever it wants to free in the end
              is not horrible, and she is actively researching what it could be.

                    <h3>What do you do when you’re not adventuring?</h3>
                    <p>Shards goes
                      on archeological digs for her own or others’ greater
                      knowledge, to get items before the bad guys do, and return
                      things to those that should have them. When not on a dig or
                      mission (which are sometimes slow work and sometimes kicking
                      action stuff), though, she works as a translator, helps
                      appraise/historically place items, reads books, or hangs
                      around the Silverside Museum of Ancient History, reading old
                      scrolls and looking at what others brought in. She also
                      likes to hang out with her family (if in town) and friends,
                      eat good food (meat, as an obligate predator), dance, drink
                      wine. She loves stories, telling and hearing them. She also
                      sometimes stealthily walks the street at night, listening
                      and watching, to calm her mind. But eventually she must feel
                      sand trickling through her paws again and the release she
                      feels when she opens something that has been locked up for
                      too long.</p>

                    <p>Mounting expeditions is expensive, often fruitless,
                      occasionally dangerous, and costs a lot of money. She needs
                      to go on them, but also needs to rest and earn a little
                      money in between. She also likes to visit with friends and
                      family and drink clean water, sleep in a bed, etc. And do
                      research in the comfort of a library or museum.</p>

                    <p>She’s going to open
                      something she should have left well alone. She is compelled
                      by the Key to find its pieces and unlock many things, and
                      sometimes that has been bad. So, in addition to following
                      the Key’s compulsions, she is trying to race the Key so she
                      can find out what it wants, in the end, before it succeeds
                      with her as its instrument. She will make bad decisions for
                      that knowledge, just as much as she is compelled to open and
                      free things.</p>

                      costs $$$. Between the magical healing, travel, food, fees,
                      contractors and costs at the gym, any prize money quicky
                      vanishes. So Redge is spends a lot of time trying to find

                      trainer); things that don't interrupt training too much to
                      pay the bills (doing publicity events, speeches,
                      endorecements); or more often than not things that pay too

              Azim has assumed a “civilian” identity as a dilettante from a lost
              Djinn-born house and tries to basically act like Bruce Wayne when
              she can’t stand being a hero. She goes by Armita Arafi in this
              guise. Also absolutely open to being monastically related to
              Eric’s character in some way.

              Azim's story and destiny are too important to end. And also his
              story had a plot twist it would cause harm for anyone else to know
              the actual truth about. For that reason, I buried him in an
              unmarked grave and have carried on his legacy.
